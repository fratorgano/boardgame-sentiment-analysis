A card can be placed as long as it has the same color or number as the last card played. There are also power cards that a player can receive and use to sabotage others. For example, there is a certain card called the draw 4 card which forces the next player to draw 4 cards unless they have another draw 4 that can stack. This is a really fun mechanic as there aren't many other card games out there that allow players to team up. Overall, I really enjoy playing Uno as every decision you make has an impact that lasts for the rest of the game, and the way the cards are randomized at the beginning doesn't give experienced players too much of an advantage.",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7528871297836304}",Positive,0.7528871297836304,1,0.7528871297836304,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7340294122695923}",Positive,0.7340294122695923,1,0.7340294122695923,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7298010587692261}",Positive,0.7298010587692261,1,0.7298010587692261,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8020462393760681}",Positive,0.8020462393760681,1,0.8020462393760681,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6701202392578125}",Positive,0.6701202392578125,1,0.6701202392578125,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5691033005714417}",Positive,0.5691033005714417,1,0.5691033005714417,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6991425156593323}",Positive,0.6991425156593323,1,0.6991425156593323

1061,darbjustic,7,"Purely ranked on nostalgia.  It really should be a 5 but I have too many good memories on this one.  Our family would go to Lake Shasta and play this at night after a day on the lake.  I love the Deluxe version from the 1980's with a black tray.  House variants we love:  1)  Speed Uno.  If you have the EXACT card (number and color--no word cards) you can cut in line.  The play advances to whoever cut in line and skips whoever was about to play and everyone in between.  If you have two of the same exact cards in your hand you have to play them separately and no double-handing it.    2) Stacking Uno.  If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four are played on you, you can do a few things....Stack on top (no matter what color, but the type of card must match).  The next player would have to deal with both cards.  In the case of two Draw Two's, the next player would then have to draw four.  If the next player has another Draw Two, they can stack on top as well, passing the consequences down the line.  If a player puts down a Draw Four, you can't stack a Draw Two on it--only another Draw Four.    One other piece to Stacking Uno, you can use a Skip or Reverse to pass the consequences accordingly.  The rules of either matching color or type still apply.    An example:  Player 1 drops a blue Draw Two.  Player 2 drops a yellow Draw Two on top.  Player 3 would have to draw four but has a yellow Skip.  Player 3 plays the yellow Skip having the consequence of drawing four cards onto Player 4.  (If player 4 had a Skip of any color or a yellow Reverse he could play it, passing the consequence appropriately.  He could not add a Draw Two/Draw Four at this point).",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8011454343795776}",Positive,0.8011454343795776,1,0.8011454343795776,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7945504188537598}",Positive,0.7945504188537598,1,0.7945504188537598,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7981398105621338}",Positive,0.7981398105621338,1,0.7981398105621338,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.803804874420166}",Positive,0.803804874420166,1,0.803804874420166,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7882872819900513}",Positive,0.7882872819900513,1,0.7882872819900513,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7671321034431458}",Positive,0.7671321034431458,1,0.7671321034431458,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7906380295753479}",Positive,0.7906380295753479,1,0.7906380295753479

1155,derekca,5,"UNO  Not much can be said about UNO. It's a modern classic. The Mattel card designs are iconic, with their bright colors and oval designs, and are simplistic enough that they lend themselves to hundreds or thousands of different iterations. Every Disney property has its own version of UNO.  The rules are simple, and lend themselves very well to playing with people with shorter attention spans - ie, children and drunks. However, as a sober adult who hadn't played UNO since I was younger, I found it to be a little more simplistic than I remember. There tend not to be very many strategies that a player can come up with when it comes to UNO, so it can get boring very fast.  Fortunately, the game lends itself well to variants, and the version I have comes with some blank cards so that you can draw your own house rules on them.  CONCLUSION: For a child, Uno is a fun and fast-paced game that is a perfect introduction to other (more complex) card games. For an adult, the strategic options are severely limited, and so it is probably more fun in a group of slightly intoxicated people who can't follow too many rules.  ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8517098426818848}",Positive,0.8517098426818848,1,0.8517098426818848,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8617837429046631}",Positive,0.8617837429046631,1,0.8617837429046631,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8491232991218567}",Positive,0.8491232991218567,1,0.8491232991218567,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8498908281326294}",Positive,0.8498908281326294,1,0.8498908281326294,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8219608068466187}",Positive,0.8219608068466187,1,0.8219608068466187,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6311919689178467}",Positive,0.6311919689178467,1,0.6311919689178467,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6858561635017395}",Positive,0.6858561635017395,1,0.6858561635017395

You have to follow suit or color depending what’s in your hand. There are wild cards and draw four wild cards to use. The wild card you can play anytime so you can change the color to something in your hand. The wild draw four cards can only be used when you don’t have the color or the number that is on top of the deck. The first person to reach 500 points is the loser.  I play this game against my 13 year old niece and her dad. I had 212 point to her 450 points and my brother and niece ganged up on me and I loss. Your odds aren’t good when its 2 against 1.

I remember it being very fun and it was something that we looked forward to.  We always played it with 5-8 people it seemed as well.  It's a quick learn, however depending on the rules you play by, it can take a long time or short time.  Playing to 500 will take a long time for two people for example, however it wouldn't take as long for 5-8 players.  I play by the rule that you have to play suit, however I have found that it doesn't actually say that in the rules, nor is that always a good strategy.  It's a good game to talk amongst family and play the game at the same time.  Good clean game.  It does have a mix of luck and strategy in this, however it's leans towards the luck.  I'd recommend giving this a game play for those familys out there with young kids learning to count and match colors.  It's also fun for teens.

The concept is easy, and some of the special cards add a little bit of strategy too it, making it not completely random. I would not suggest playing it nowadays, but it is a neat nostalgic game. However, we introduced a version of ""cheating uno"" with my young cousins. You place all cards face down and say what that card is – being allowed to lie about it, of course. If you doubt someone was speaking the truth, the next person in line may challenge it, resulting in either of them being penalized.

Repeated play is encouraged to relive shared moments or simply to avenge previously being targeted.

3165,mildthrill,5,"Game in a Nutshell: Take turns discarding one of your cards onto the pile which matches an element (color, symbol, number) of the card before it. Draw cards if you can't play and go until someone runs out.  Played as: 3,4,5,6 players  Pros: As far as games go, this scales pretty darn well for any number I've played with. A game where you get to make some decisions and AP should never factor in. Good portability.  No Thanks! is probably the only better game I know that plays this quick, but I think this might have a wider appeal still for being less to think about and higher visual appeal.

3212,mmrempen,10,"Incredible game. Production value is through the roof - cards are very sturdy with excellent snapback. The gloss is high quality, perfect for repelling spilled liquids. Even with the high production quality I will probably supplement with upgraded components like an organizer as this is one of my most played games. The colors are very brightly printed and the numbers crisp and clear - never any confusion in our games between yellow and blue for example, and the often-confused 9 and 6 are here ingeniously marked by a - so you know which is which. Setup and tear down are very quick, basically instantaneous. The teach is relatively simple, especially if you wait to teach the more complex rules (draw 4, for example) until they come up in-game.   The game itself has very high player interaction, a bit of randomness (card draw) but a wide and crunchy deep decision space - agonizing over whether to follow a color or play to the number is the highlight of the game. Strategies run the gamut - play the wilds now and gain short term advantage, or save them for later when options become slim? There’s always a way to work a new angle. Hand management is also a fun mini game to work on during down time (there are lengthy debates in my house about whether to sort your hand by color or by number), although there isn’t much down time as you can only play one card, and sometimes not even that!

3247,MormonVoodoo,1,"Without any additional rules, you might as well play ""war."" There is no point to playing this game. It fits the requirements for a real game as soon as you add the well-known homebrew rule ""doubles,"" allowing you to quickly play a card out of turn (provided that you play it on a card that matches in both color AND number, i.e. a red 9 on a red 9.  You must also play it quick enough that the next player doesn't play on top of the card you're trying to ""double."")  If you want to raise the rating of Uno from 1 to 10, here's a tiny sampling of some of our ""Brutal Uno"" rules (dubbed ""Mormon Uno"" in Monroe, WA), the only variant I'm still willing to play:  Here's the link to the full rules listed out by yours truly: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905029/brutal-uno-best-medley-homebrew-rules-weve-ever-fo  ---------------------------------------------------  Doubles: you may play a card out of turn if it is the exact same card as the card on top of the stack. (You have to go fast though, before someone covers up the card you have the duplicate of)  Binary Zeros: Anytime someone plays a 1, the 1 starts a new pile. When multiple piles are in play, people can pick where to play their card on their turn. In addition, players can interrupt turn order by doubling the top of any pile. Whenever someone plays a 0, they pick up the pile that the 0 was played on and then place it on any other pile (if there is another pile). That pile has been closed.  Additive 2s: when you play a 2, you can immediately play 3 more cards, if the first two cards add up to the last card. For example, on my turn I could play a 2, 5, 1, and 6 (5+1=6). NOTE: the sequence can legally be interrupted by another player doubling one of the middle cards. The player after you can also prevent the sequence by taking their turn after you've played the 2 but before you've started the additive sequence. Final note: any special effects of the middle cards are ignored entirely, but the effect of the final card is applied (if applicable).  Stacking: If someone plays a draw 2 or draw 4, the next person can stack an additional draw 2 or draw 4 on it, adding to the total value that someone has to draw.  Extended Stacking: People can also use reverses and skips in response to draw2s and draw4s, forcing the draw attack to change directions or pass by a target. There are limits in stacking. Stacking still requires the same type of card or the same color. For example, a blue reverse can't be used to block a red draw2. If someone plays a draw4, the next person can play a draw2/reverse/skip of any color if he can play it before the draw4 player declares a color.  This is less than a third of the rules to Brutal Uno.

Its really simple and plays quickly making it a suitable game for the filler slot.  There's very little in the way of strategy though, as with everything relying on card draw you will often find you can win almost immediately (or not even stand a chance when you get stuck between two players with loads of screw cards).

There should be card games this simple, it's nice that they exist. It's just that this one has literally no significant decisions. But would the world be a better place if everyone decided that their card game of choice was 6 Nimmt! or No Thanks! instead? Yes, although the problem with 6 Nimmt! is that it doesn't hit the lower player counts well and the problem with No Thanks! is that for the Uno crowd, I really do think having to carry around a number of easy to lose tokens, which could create problems playing it at the higher player counts, is a problem. Someday an Uno replacement will come, but it will have to be dirt simple, accommodate strategic try-hards like myself as well as people who want to just lay down a card and see what happens, and easy to just toss the deck into a bag.

Follow the simple rules we used when we were children and you will thank me forever:  - Do not, I repeat, Do not use the scoring system. Whoever finishes first wins the game. First player that reaches a certain amount of wins, is the final winner.   - Do not use the +4 cards.  - When somebody plays a +2 card on you, you can also play a +2 (if you have one). In this case you don't get to draw 2 cards and the next player has to draw 4 cards (unless he also has a +2 card).  Yes that makes the game extremely simple but that's exactly the point. You can't get serious with UNO. It's a nonsence game. If you want sth more serious, just don't play UNO. It was a designers mistake trying to make UNO a more serious game in the first place.

3775,Pretty Haus,7,"1971, what a year.  -Led Zeplin performs ""Stairway to Heaven"" live, for the first time -Apollo 14 lands on the Moon -Great Britain leaves the imperial numbering system for the Decimal system -Arsenal wins the FA Cup -Merle Robbins introduced his family to his newly invented game, ""Uno"". Although based strongly on card games already in existance, Robbins' inclusion of bright colours paved his way to Card Game domination of the 70's, 80's and 90's.  Best House Rules: 1) Uno Sevens Same as original game, however any '7' can be played on any card, irrelivant of number and colour. i.e. you could play a Blue 7 on a Green 4, or even play your '7' on a Wild card after someone has named a colour you don't have. You can also play a seven in the usual manner, however prepare yourself to be ridiculed for your misplay.   2) Duo Based on the original Uno, Duo is played much the same, except players get an extra 3-5 cards and there are 2 discard piles. This leads to such stratergies as locking both discard piles to the same colour, or leaving a draw 2 on a pile open, ready for anyone to pounce on. In addition, players must now call ""Duo!"" when down to 2 cards. If they are caught, they must draw 3 cards. A player can only play 1 card per turn, EXCEPT for when they are on 2 cards remaining. If a player can play their last 2 cards at the same time, they may finish the game in this manner. Please note, the player must play a card on EACH discard pile, you cannot just put your last 2 cards on top of each other.  3) Uno Three's Same Uno rules, except 3's of any colour are now ""Me Again"" cards. Player gets another turn. Use them to your advantage to finish with two or more cards left in hand.  4) Combinations: -Seventy-Three's",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8303478956222534}",Positive,0.8303478956222534,1,0.8303478956222534,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8098993897438049}",Positive,0.8098993897438049,1,0.8098993897438049,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8153302073478699}",Positive,0.8153302073478699,1,0.8153302073478699,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8141388297080994}",Positive,0.8141388297080994,1,0.8141388297080994,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8201521635055542}",Positive,0.8201521635055542,1,0.8201521635055542,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7709614634513855}",Positive,0.7709614634513855,1,0.7709614634513855,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8194538354873657}",Positive,0.8194538354873657,1,0.8194538354873657

House rules we use:  1. +2/+4 cards can be stacked (block a plus 2 with another, putting +4 on the third, who can use a +2 to put 6 on the next. This will always get laughs. 2. If a card gets played, and you have the exact same card (number and color), you can play it immediately, and the rotations continue from you. Keeps people to pay attention to the game instead of wandering off. 3. Last card cannot be Wild +4. This is more of an addendum to rule 1 so you can't use it as an instant win card. But sometimes it got ignored.  Game got lost in moving from state to state, but still decent memories.

We also developed our own set of 'keywords' that now must be said with it's matching card or you have to pick up 2, or 4, or 6, depending on who's playing lol   To give you an idea: 1 = Merlie (said in the appropriate American Gothic accent)  2 is often called 'Not Merlie' but it's an unofficial house-rule so you're not penalized if it's not said .. 3/6/9 = Bill/Bill Bill/Bill Bill Bill accordingly (True Blood) 4 = Swarley (How I Met Your Mother) 5 = you can pretty much quote any conversation or line from Big Fish, but accent IS important! 7 = It's hammer time! (daughters reference to Glee not MC Hammer as such, though personally it reminds me of Dexter) 8 = Doughboy (Drew Carey, well Mimi but you follow) 2+ = Ice Ice Baby (again from Glee) when putting down multiples = Oh My Gravy (cowboys from the Amazing Race) and any colour changing wildcard = Sookie (again True Blood, and ironically she is called ""quite the wildcard"" in the book series but we didn't find that out until after it was added!)   I highly recommend adding even just a couple of your own keywords as it really enhances the game .. The more you add the more confusing it gets, and that's the way we like it - UNO PLUS!

4741,thelastemperor,6,"OK, UNO is... UNO. Only a tautology will serve to describe it.   It was so much fun as a kid. I still enjoy a game now and then. Uno is one of those games that works best for people who want “a game”. You know, the same kind of people who revel in hearts or some other card game, or Scrabble, or Boggle, or Rummy Cube, or  Yahtzee. They learn the game until it becomes automatic, like muscle memory. A comfort food for the mind.   If you’re looking for replay-ability due to depth, variation of choices, or anything like that, then you may frown on the simplistic joy of having a game that you can grab, and just play, with the speed and precision of a couple of 11-year olds doing Cat’s Cradle, or like mindlessly zoning out to that favorite sitcom you’ve seen so many times you know each episode by heart. For me, I’d usually much rather play Battle Line, or Sushi-Go, or Guillotine, or Lost Cities, or… ANY NUMBER of other options that also fall (more or less so) into this category. But for a long time I felt outright cynical and judgmental toward this oldie classic. Until my 8 year-old kept begging me to play over and over again and, after having a chance to get back into the mind-frame of the game, started to recall those instincts and dopamine hits of matching colors and slapping down a draw four just as another player is trying to get rid of their last card, or catching someone for not saying “Uno”. It’s a lot like the zen of playing something like Tetris, where the joy is just in endlessly repeating something basic, but fun.   Here’s the honest truth that’s hard to see because we’re all so tainted by perspective: if this was a brand new game that no one had ever seen before, it would probably get high praise for being “simple, but addictive”. It doesn’t have the kind of interesting strategic choices that something like Sushi-Go has, but give it 40 or 50 years and I wonder if attitudes toward that classic won’t be similarly dismissive as they are today toward Uno. It’s because most of us played this game TO DEATH in our childhoods and not only did we eventually get bored of it, but forever associated it with being a “kids game”.   The other key thing with Uno is how you play. Just as every group of friends or family or household seemed to have its own rules for Monopoly,  or unique special rules for Stratego, there seemed to be endless variations on the basic rules for Uno. That was, and maybe it still, part of the charm. The replay-ability comes not from multiple player roles or difference scenarios, or a “lifetime to master” depth that comes from subtle nuance in different strategies and tactics… nope, here it comes from the fact that just matching up colors and numbers and trying to get rid of cards while also trying to give your opponents a little “take that!” action is undeniably fun and breezy and worth repeating over and over on rainy weekends or other moments that call for something like this.    Hate on it if you want, as there are lots of other things to play out there and certainly many I’d rather play most of the time, but there’s still room in life to acknowledge and respect that some games earn their place in the popular consciousness not just as trends (pogs?) but because they actually have a winning formula in their own right, beyond whatever reputation they might eventually pick up along the inevitable passage of time.",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.819003701210022}",Positive,0.819003701210022,1,0.819003701210022,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8064348697662354}",Positive,0.8064348697662354,1,0.8064348697662354,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8180230259895325}",Positive,0.8180230259895325,1,0.8180230259895325,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.807593047618866}",Positive,0.807593047618866,1,0.807593047618866,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7789455652236938}",Positive,0.7789455652236938,1,0.7789455652236938,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7361049652099609}",Positive,0.7361049652099609,1,0.7361049652099609,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7553930282592773}",Positive,0.7553930282592773,1,0.7553930282592773

The purple and brown colors for this game is horrendous and under poor lighting, it is hard to differentiate. Awful for color blind folks.  OK, as a general rating with kids, Uno falls on a 6. It is not a great game by any sane measure, but it is a good filler with young kids at 5 years of age. My daughter was thrilled to grasp the concepts after 2-3 plays and I think she will find some enjoyment from 5-6 years. As she gets exposed to more games, I'd expect her to drop Uno in favor of others.   The best feature of Uno is its simplicity. The rules are easy to teach and regurgitate, even for young ones.

5176,Woelf,6,"A childhood favorite.   We played the hell out of this in high school study hall too, and have even brought it out and enjoyed it a few times since then.  A bit on the dull side when played by the standard rules, but gets much more interesting with a few house rules:  1)  Draw 2/4 cards can be stacked. If the first player puts down a Draw 2, the second player can play another Draw 2 on top (instead of drawing).  The next player in line then has to draw all four cards - or play yet another Draw card on top, which bumps up even more for the next player.  Repeat until someone can't (or chooses not to!) play a Draw card on top, and then they get to draw the whole set.   A Draw 4 can be played freely on a Draw 2 or another Draw 4, but a Draw 2 can only be played on a Draw 4 if it matches the color that was called.  2)  Playing a valid card from your hand is not mandatory. This often leads to players holding onto Draw cards until the very end, rather than wasting them when they have nothing else to play.  Often someone would rather draw a few extra cards than drop a Draw 4 if they still have several other cards left in their hand.  3)  If you can't play a card on your turn (or choose not to), you have to draw cards one at a time until you can - but you don't have to stop if you find a playable card. This results in the interesting tactic where players will often intentionally pick up a few extra cards, on the off chance they might find an all-powerful Draw 4.  4)  The ""YOU DIDN'T CALL UNO!"" thing we usually let slide up until the next person plays a card.   None of this, ""you didn't call Uno within 2 milliseconds of playing your card, so draw!"" crap that some groups encounter.   If you still haven't called it by the time the next player plays a card, then you're boned.   Combined these can make the game take a lot longer, but it makes for a much more enjoyable game.",2223,en,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6441651582717896}",Positive,0.6441651582717896,1,0.6441651582717896,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6250398755073547}",Positive,0.6250398755073547,1,0.6250398755073547,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6243531703948975}",Positive,0.6243531703948975,1,0.6243531703948975,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6496478915214539}",Positive,0.6496478915214539,1,0.6496478915214539,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6243480443954468}",Positive,0.6243480443954468,1,0.6243480443954468,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6107234358787537}",Positive,0.6107234358787537,1,0.6107234358787537,"{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6277483701705933}",Positive,0.6277483701705933,1,0.6277483701705933

It's wildly swingy (especially when played with stackable draw actions) and almost completely devoid of any real decision-making.  But it does manage to do an okay job of allowing players to mess with one another and is truly ripe for table-talk and banter, as players mess with their neighbors and sass those who get close to winning.  In the end, I'm honestly so tired of UNO I can't imagine a scenario in which I'd really want to play it ever again, but I do think it's still a fine game to pull out with just about anyone wanting to kill some time with people.
