2,100pcBlade,8,"Everdell doesn’t really offer anything new but what it does do it does very well. It is engaging, plays very smoothly with no rough edges and it looks pretty well balanced which is no mean design achievement given that there are 48 different cards in the base game. And the variability that all those cards, different set-up and expansions offers keeps the game pretty fresh. The tree is totally impractical and unneccssary though. Keep it in the box",199792

It's pretty basic worker placement, but the theme and art elevate the experience.  It's easy to get to the table, and is a lovely mid weight strategy game.  The expansions add a little bit of depth and mechanics and provide opportunities for more variety.  They do a great job at adding variety without compromising the overall good vibes that this game puts out.",199792

18,aaj94,7,"It's fitting that Everdell ends up right alongside Wingspan, as I think of them both in the same breath. Beautifully polished presentation, a warmed-over repackaged set of mechanics that aren't innovative but are frequently delightful. Sure, it doesn't do anything [i]new[/i], but is it such a bad thing to repackage old ideas in a new and lovely presentation?   Tableau builders are right up my alley, and Everdell marries that with a feather-weight worker placement game, which gives it just that touch of extra interaction that I'm looking for (where [thing=266192][/thing] by contrast, is a more heads-down affair)  The first strategy step that Everdell grants you is figuring out the powerful green card effects. Because green cards fire up to four times during the game (if you play one first round), they can be very powerful resource generators for very cheap. Learning how to 'stretch' your engine far beyond your available workers is a key first step into Everdell strategy.   After 15 plays, more depth has appeared. The deck is learnable, even though it's big, which unlocks deck churn, searching for powerful combos. Some of the 'undervalued' card draw actions now take on more value in our eyes, as we learn how those can get you the Ever Tree, or some equivalently powerful card.   I think of Everdell as a perfect ""main course"" game that won't melt everyone's brains, nor repel the newbie gamers. It's a little bit too long at 5, but most games are. With 3, particularly, it shines with an under 90-minute play time.  Everdell doesn't have as much depth as [thing=68448][/thing], where there are a dozen good ways to win, but I don't hold that against the game. [thing=110327][/thing] happened to be the first game in this vein (in fact, LoW might have been one of the earliest 'polished' lightweight games that was marketed to a new incoming generation of gamers), but I prefer Everdell. Another similar game is [thing=270970][/thing], but it is much lighter, and uninteresting after a few plays. Consequently, Everdell has stuck in my collection where others didn't.  Again, for what it is, this is an excellent midweight game to keep in the collection. Like I mentioned above, [thing=266192][/thing] and [thing=231733][/thing] are both similar tableau builders, but different enough -- and tableau building being a mechanism that I enjoy enough -- that I don't think I will ever downsize any of the three.  [COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#66CC33][b] EXPANSION(s) OWNED: [/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] [thing=332390][/thing] - yet to play [thing=289057][/thing] - Standard more-stuff expansion, no reason not to play with most of these modules.

27,Abdul,7.5,"I was tempted to buy this, based on the amazing art alone. After a couple of plays though, I found the tableau building too shallow and uninteresting. The combos depend too much on drawing specific card pairs that only work with each other, which made the gameplay too rigid. I generally prefer card games that give you more flexibility and multiple ways to use your cards. Still a pleasant game that I would be happy to play though. Don’t under estimate the appeal of cute animals.  EDIT: While it is still a bit simple for my tastes, it is always a pleasure to play. A solid gateway game with just enough decision making to keep a veteran engaged. The cardboard tree is worthless and gets more tattered with each assembly.",199792

Eventually it looks like it's about to fall apart after a handful of plays.

33,ablehat,4,"The core game is very disappointing. 'Luck' should generally be exciting, but the myriad of duplicate cards and dull combo potential, wrapped up in a 2 hour game is unforgivable. There didn't need to be that many worker placement spots; there are so many (especially when players are adding more and more into their personal tableaus) and all of them are uninteresting. The artwork is lovely, the graphic design/layout art is not. The tree hinders gameplay rather than helps - the event scoring tiles are located underneath it, hidden away from view.  I want to like it for the theme and easy gameplay, but most of the design work hinders all of my enjoyment.",199792

Perfectly enjoyable. Solo mode is very light in maintenance so is fast to play. Enjoyable. However, sometimes you just get crazy-lucky... like when I had 10 cards out by end of Spring, tons of points, and then had the cards come out to let me get rid of stuff to put better end-game stuff out. Fine in solo but could be painful in multiplayer if you're getting bad luck while your opponent has some insane chain going. It's a fun game, I'd play it again, but not sure I need to keep on owning it when I have some many tableau-builder games.",199792

63,adamtay11,8.6,"[b]Taylor's 100 point rating:[/b]  [b]Enjoyment - 17/20[/b] - Everdell is one of the best games to try and get non-gamers into. It’s really fun and has a ton strategy, but is also really cute, beautiful and very thematic. Everdell is a game that I love, and everyone I’ve played with has loved it.  [b]Replayability - 14/15[/b] - This game has plenty of replayability, with new action locations being drawn every turn, different end game goals and just the luck of the cards you draw. Everdell seems to be a little different every game. I do think that there’s a small amount of room for improvement here, but not much.  [b]Game Mechanics - 11/15[/b] - Everdell has a very fun set of mechanics that aren’t all that unique to work placement games. Building your little town is very fun and rewarding, but having players play in different seasons can be a bit confusing. The helps a lot with gameflow and pacing. It’s fun to try and find cool card combos and invite critters to areas that are appealing to them.  [b]Theme/Artwork - 15/15[/b] - I know lots of people who play Everdell for the theme alone. The designers do such a good job of immersing you in this cute little forest with lots of different cute critters. The game is beautiful, and very immersive. They even have a big popup tree in the middle of your gameboard in case you forgot you’re in the forest!  [b]Gameflow/Pace - 7/10[/b] - Turns are quite fast, which keeps you from otherwise getting bored during other players’ turns. I also mentioned a little bit about playing through seasons and not having to wait for other players to finish each season, but there are games where some players will still be playing long since you finished and that can be boring, but doesn't always happen.  [b]Flexibility - 8/10[/b] - I wish you could play with more than 4 players, but the game plays really well anywhere between 1-4 characters. I appreciate this a lot as a frequent solo gamer.    [b]Production - 5/5[/b] - The game pieces and cards are REALLY high quality. Even the little berries being so tactile and soft, while maintaining a good shape. Most board games get a 5 out of a 5, but this game goes above and beyond in this category that I seriously thought about giving it a 6.  [b]Effort To Play - 5/5[/b] - This game is a very quick setup, and I usually don’t have to try and convince anyone to pull this off that shelf. I can setup before hand or quickly after choosing the game.  [b]Accessibility - 4/5[/b] - For the most part, this game is pretty easy to get into and the rules are too complex. It’s not quite as easy as some other games, like Concordia, but the theme makes the game very inviting to new players.  [b]Total Score: 86/100[/b]  Here's my ratings reference if you want to know what each metric means to me: https://1drv.ms/w/s!ArFa02CatjgkhLFXx_D7binitdMglw?e=jlOOMl ",199792
64,adamw,8,"Obviously the game is beautifully illustrated. And the components (of the deluxe copy only?) are very nicely done. The large tree is rather (well) large, but sets the tone for the game - fun in itself. So presentation, top notch. Game play - it is a combination card game which is normally something I do not enjoy. Here, however, because of the realized theme, I do enjoy it very much indeed. Looking forward to another play to improve my score.",199792

69,adebisi,7,"Probably one of the cutest wolves in sheep’s clothing. Just by looking at components everything suggest that this is a mellow family game but the reality turned out something else. This is a really tight (one could even say brutally tight) engine builder. You are very limited in resources and actions and the only way to break these restraints is to build an engine to boost your resource production. However, this proved to be a rather difficult task to do, for the engines you are looking for largely depend on good card combos. The tricky thing here is that many cards in the game interact directly only with one other card in the deck, and hence you cannot be certain of establishing any kind of combos. At least I found myself scraping for whatever small advantages I could find for most of the first half of the game before I found anything resembling solid ground on which to build the foundations for my end game. And it was not only me who was struggling. My opponent who is an experienced player as well had a similar experience.   But the question - was it fun. I would say yes. The way the cards worked and interacted with other cards felt fresh and exciting. The theme and the art appealed to me at least. Playing time was reasonable. And the game offered a challenge for experienced players as well. My only concern is that some sessions may suffer from too big swings in the luck. If you just do not hit any combos while your opponents does, there really is no way to fight the wave, it will wash over you. If you can live with that, I could recommend Everdell.",199792
70,adel9591,6,"Pretty art, but engine building is on the bland side and a little too tight for my taste (very limited number of workers). It's long for what it is, and I'd argue it's on the complex side given the limited number of things you can do. Lots of fluff, to summarize, but not a great design.",199792

As for the conclusion, luckily, the beauty of Everdell is captured by its gameplay. Meaningful decisions, fast setup, interesting combination of worker placement, hand management and card drafting, wonderful artwork, lovely theme, card variety and lots of replayability straight out of the box make for a very enjoyable game.",199792

Nice artwork. + Love how when you start it feels like there is not enough actions but the engine builds till there are so many options by the end of the game - The tree is a little over the top - Since it is a light-weight game not a huge deal, but there is definite swings in luck based on what cards you are able to buy on your turn",199792

76,Aditceria,5,"The art is magnificent, but the downtime and the strategic decision of every move is not there for me, so that in the long game it will easily becomes boring.",199792
77,adi_venturer,6,"I know this game is extremely popular, but it just didn't do it for me the one time I played it.   I'll start off by saying that I LOVE how this game looks. The art is beautiful, and the pieces are very high quality. It has great table presence too (really cool looking tree!). The theme of the game is also right up my alley. I can also see how this game would be the pinnacle of tableau building for those looking to invest the time and energy.  Here's why Everdell didn't click for me:  1. The game isn't thematic, the theme is mostly painted on. I like the woodland critter theme but it doesn't tie into the mechanics at all. The tree serves no purpose in the game. It's a dry Euro at the end of the day.  2. You need to know all the cards to play this game well, which creates a high barrier to entry. I typically don't mind this as I prefer to invest in games I like by playing them over and over, as opposed to always trying new games. So for people who like this game, I can see how the game could be super satisfying as you build combos. For me, it was a bit too much to read the small printing on my cards (we were playing in a dimly lit bar), and also keep track of the text on everyone else's tableau.   3. The season system is the biggest sin this game commits IMO. It makes it so that experienced Everdell players would stay in early seasons earning points, while less experienced players would end the game early and then just have to wait around (in our case for 60 minutes) for them to finish up. This is worse than player elimination, because you still have to stick around for end game scoring.  I might give this game another shot in the future, but it is unlikely I'll ever find the motivation to invest the time and effort this game demands, which I'd rather spend on campaign games or games I'm already invested in.

The core mechanic of getting a free critter if you have the matching construction is cute, but the deck is far too big to really rely on it, with very few ways of increasing card draw.  You can play from your hand or from a display of 8 cards which does help somewhat, but the cards in the collective pool can gum up real easy.  Feels like it should be a light and breezy game but somehow ends up taking 2-3 hours which this game absolutely does no warrant.  I have the complete collection, as my partner enjoys it, but the expansions make the already extemely obnoxious centre board even bigger.  Some of the expansions add some good mechanics but they bloat the playtime, making the game more crunchy which I just feel is not something this game should be doing.",199792

97,agentpatman,8,"Really confused and frustrated about this one. On one hand it's an awesome production with great art. On the other it's fairly luck driven tactical game. I would be surprised to find someone who could win if one player started with some nice combo cards and the other had to spend their only two workers in round 1 of 3 discarding and then drawing new cards. Feels like such a disadvantage. Continue the luck throughout the rounds and I really start to wonder how much strategy is really here. It's difficult to build an engine and I probably wouldn't call this engine building at all, more tableau buildings. How do you beat someone gaining tons of free critters while your struggling to get enough resources for anything. Maybe you can become a veteran player but calculating the odds and really studying the game to know how to react based on certain card draws. However as a casual game this leaves me disappointed since it seems so random without a lot of frustration trying to cycle through the deck as fast as possible in an already tight game. The wife likes it so it's rated higher than I'd give it. After the second play I have come to appreciate this a little more. I am still not there yet. I still find it frustrating how slow it ramps up. The last round feels like it turns into a game and is be my enjoyable but I am not sure it makes all the time it took to get there worth it. I can’t help but wish the game was built around how you feel in the last round where you have workers to activate cards to pull off combos. It still seems very luck dependent as some players still get a lot for free from simply a card draw. So for me I’d love a faster ramp up, maybe a focus on removing early cards from your tableau towards the end, way to cycle through the deck faster. It’s almost there for me but not yet. Maybe after more players I’ll come to appreciate the randomness and see the tactics more.",199792

I struggled a bit with the 20 minutes of waiting for the other people to finish after I had already filled my city and spent my meeples. However, it is the game most requested at our weekly game night and I also love the solo version, which means I have had a lot more games since and my opinion of the game has improved even more. The many different ways to get victory provide interesting choices and strategies, the artwork is beyond stunning and the game feels wonderful to play. There are interesting ways to make it even more interesting, as someone suggested giving every class of meeple critters a special strength or ability, but it does not even necessarily need it, the game is simply wonderful to play.",199792

119,Airborne_GR,10,"Everdell combines worker placement and engine building and does it very well, introducing interesting unique rules to both of those mechanisms. It provides players satisfaction as their villges grow. I find the seasons mechanism of trying  to efficiently squeeze as many actions in one season particularly clever. I'd say that the level of replayability is quite high with different worker placment slots, score goals and card combinations coming up with every playthrough. A single strategy won't be able to win you two games.  I believe that out of all the games I've played this one is the most beautiful on the table. The production quality is top notch, the cards the resources, (I have the edition that logs are not perfect cylinders), the rulebook, the insert, the box, everything. I've seen people complaining about two fair problems, that some text is quite small and that it can hurt you if you don't know the deck. Both are sovled after 2-3 playes. Personally I remember almost what every card does.  Solo mode captures the theme of the game and actually provides a good challenge. (Quite a few more plays in Tabletopia) ",199792

136,akboognish,5,"I originally rated this an 8 based on game-play and enjoyment level. But I've reassessed given the failure of the designer and publisher to deal with the sexist / heteronormative husband/wife cards. I've heard the arguments that the cards are sweet, are personal to the designer, and I can always house-rule. But the fact is that wife is worth half as much when not paired with the husband, the husband only works if paired with the wife, and both are very explicitly female/male. These two cards are anomalies given the rest of the deck, and the designer has described them as being a way for him to ""show the 'normal people,' or, should I say, 'normal critters'."" These are big problems for me and will prevent me from playing in the future. I can maybe be convinced to play it, I suppose, with house-rules for those cards (most likely changing their names with tape or marker to ""tiller"" and ""farmer"") but it would have to be a strong sell. Too bad, as the game is fun outside of that huge problem. EDIT: upped rating to 5 because the publisher has finally come up with ""Everdell for Everyone"" cards that address the husband/wife issues. But since getting rid of the game we've had no strong desire to play it, regardless of the cards. It was a nice but already forgettable experience.",199792

140,akros,9,"I absolutely love both the artwork and the mechanics.   The game plays very smoothly - it's intuitive but has depth.  In my experience, this is extremely rare and what one should really aim for when designing a game (or designing anything really!).   The way I see it, one way this was achieved is with a fine balance in the hierarchy or mechanics: the hierarchy feels mostly flat (i.e. one does not have to think about multiple, nested, what if scenarios), and can definitely be played OK as flat. But at the same time, it also allows some depth if one wants to look at it.  Specifically, I see the game has having roughly these order of mechanics:   first order: place workers  second order: build building, cards in hand management, resources management, mechanics that move workers, victory points  third order: actions that affect second order mechanics  ----  It has also high replayability - at the time of writing, we are 30 games into it, still enjoy it 100% and still discovering new interactions.   Some points that make Everdell stand out from other games, for me at least:  - love how you can play against other people, but it still doesn't feel like a very competitive game  - love how you can play against other people, but you still have space and time to do some deep planning and get lost in your thoughts as you would with solo games  - the artwork, wow. It's stunning, looking at the board and the tree makes me feel relaxed and entertained. I also love the physical feeling of rolling the berries in my hand, and how each resource type is physically different across colors, texture and shape :)   ----  Originally gave it a 10, revising to 9 because after ~10 games, I realized that the space of winning conditions is more limited than I originally perceived. And although the are SO many ways to get there, I feel like some diversity in winning scenarios might have been nice.  I.e. at the moment you have: 1. build as many ""earn X for each Y"" cards  2. activate as many efficient ""exchange Y for X"" as possible",199792

144,Alan Stern,8,"Tableau-building worker-placement combo-oriented!  And darn good at that!  I like the underlying base of seeking combos to form your ""engine"" (there really isn't an engine per se, but the combos hopefully fit together well enough to drive your actions).  I like how you have two places to use - a public sphere (the meadow) and a private sphere (your hand).  I like how the game has a certain pacing to it - players don't progress through the seasons together but rather individually and this creates some cool dynamics.  I almost like where the point-scoring resides (I worry that a few of the cards might be powerful enough to unbalance the scoring aspect, but that could just be accepted as part of the game).  I like the big tree, as unnecessary (CRITICAL!) as it is.  I like the basic objectives and special objectives.  It all works together quite well.  My only legitimate fear is that the replay value is on the low side since I already routinely fish for cards.  A significant part of the game is finding your combo elements, either for progression or scoring the special objectives, and the game mostly enables this (or at least it's there if you want it).  Beyond the forest worker spots and the special objectives, each play is not tremendously different - it's on me to push differently or do different things.  Which could become reductive if I have a preferred plan or if a certain strategy is dominant.  Regardless, it's a lot of fun and I wholeheartedly recommend this one!",199792

I get the feeling the game is playing me instead of me playing the game, I can't let go the impression that I should be making the decision on how many workers I want to get.  One of the aspects of the game that is also off putting is that many card goals and combos rely on specific cards that may never come within reach. Of course this means you should remain flexible in your plans, and some of it also happens in RFTG, but I thought here the requirements were too specific, making everything much more brittle.

201,allan647,8,"8/19/2023 - Closing in on 4 years into the hobby, I've seen a lot of games of the ilk: Place workers -> Get Resources -> Play cards with Resources OR Combo a free play card action if you have the corresponding partner card in your tableau -> Production -> Repeat(process till game end) -> VPs. The aesthetics and production is what Everdell has in its favour to attract new gamers like my grade-school year-old niece, and sneakily teach them fundamentals of math and economics : ) and most importantly, the mechanical and conceptual foundation of most Euro-style games which can be used as a teaching tool to more complex and varied game types in other board game genres like 18xx, Pax, and 4x hopefully : ).  Overall, I'd put this in the gateway category of games, and I'm sticking with a Vegas Hard 8 on the rating.  The solo mode is fun and challenging.  Played once with 4, and was fun even though I finished dead last by a lot : ).  The font size on the cards is way too small for a 4 player game, which I had hoped they would've corrected in the 2nd printing, but did not.  Also, the Special Event Cards on the trees could have used a vertical stand.  The 2 people furthest away from the Tree in my play group had to stand up a lot to look at the cards, and were at a disadvantage because the Special Event cards were hard for them to see.  Otherwise, it's a really good game with some moderate usability issues that need correction, so I knocked down my score.  Aside from the moderate usability issues, the game itself I'd grade about 8.5-9.0.",199792

223,AlyssaC,7,"The game dynamic and design here are excellent.  I've really enjoyed playing this.  HOWEVER, the complexity of set up and the variety of moves in play puts a premium on clearly written instructions organized in an intuitive way, and this is where Everdell falls apart.  There were typos and contradictions everywhere, and forget trying to go back through the rule book in the middle of the game for a rule clarification.  I would play this again, but only with people who already know the game, because I can't bring myself to inflict the rule book on my loved ones.  Play this game, but go find a video explanation of how to play and save yourself the heartburn.",199792
224,alzsara,8,"In many ways it's Terraforming Mars in another guise, with a card engine, milestones, and awards. The lack of board presence is less exciting though. The ability to buy and build directly from an 8 card draft makes the game even more about hoping the right card comes at the right time, and building an engine differently from your RH neighbours to maximise the chances that the cards you want will still be there by the time you can afford them. I'm a sucker for card engines, but the game is as slow as nature, with everyone reading the continual replenishment of the 8 card pool and trying to squint-read the miniscule font (*sigh*) that allows one card to auto-build a partnered card, 7 Wonders style. The game boils down to the hunt for partnered synergies. I liked how each player could declare their own timing on when to retrieve their workers and activate cards. Not sure about match to theme, but a nice mechanic. Kudos for the cool tree which excites people, even if it is completely superfluous and solely about justifying the exorbitant price tag - it's a good game, but still, there's nothing in the box but cards.",199792

282,Andy Parsons,7,"Everdell takes us to several over-familiar places.  There is gathering different combinations of four different resources in order to build things. There is tableau building, with the accustomed mix of instant effects, repeated benefits, end game bonuses, and combos.  There is a very familiar tension between building a production engine and playing the cards that will score significant victory points.  And then there is worker placement, with the most desirable spots accommodating a solitary worker.    Everdell's one innovation is its seasons and the potential for players to progress through them at different speeds.  Indeed, getting out of step with your opponents is a good thing when it frees up key worker placement spots for you or allows you to deny others access to them.  The one potential downside is that players could be reduced to spectators in the endgame by an opponent who is taking their time (and likely winning).  The selection of eight cards in the meadow, available to all, is something of a double-edged sword.  It is useful in mitigating the luck of the draw, but it can also generate analysis paralysis by presenting players with a choice of up to 16 cards.  The forest cards (worker placement spots) and special events (objectives) offer a degree of variation from game to game.  Everdell does combine its over-familiar elements into a game that plays smoothly and enjoyably.  However, I do wonder how much play there is in it, without bolting on one of those expensive expansions.  The cards are a little flimsy.  The tree is both easily damaged and it gets in the way.  The rules are an easy read.  The artwork is charming.  Who doesn't like anthropomorphic woodland animals?",199792

You're trying to build a great little engine to pump out resources, but there are only 3 seasons to play through. The first season feels so quick and the game feels like it will be very short, but Fall can go on and on with all the possible moves. One bad play can really ruin your season, but you always have enough resources to stay competitive.  The game itself is over produced. The artwork is ridiculously charming with anthropomorphic woodland creatures and the game itself is fantastic. It even has a tree to house your cards, creatures and goals.   All in all, this is a charming game with interesting choices to be made every turn. Very strategic and rewards forward thinking. ",199792

However there's always a pair that belongs together that you're trying to play together and of those pairs 3-4 copies exist in the deck, so half of your ""city"" will be the same each game. It might improve with the expansion but at that price point I expect much more from the base game alone and wasn't willing to invest more to find out if it really improves and adds replayability.

332,apathetichschizoid,3,"I tried hard to like it. Even played with the recommended 3 players, it's probably near the bottom of the worker placement favorite list of mine. It seems like a game you need to heavily houserule to make it interesting. Without a mulligan/draft feature, it's very heavily luck based. While the meadow offsets it a bit, whoever can get green cards or blue cards out in the first season or two is really far ahead. Once you're at max hand size, you can't even draw another card and then discard down to limit, so you're always trying to decide the least worse decision if your luck is terrible. Compared to a game like stone age, they offer up tools which can help mitigate bad luck and may even give you some really good results some times so you aren't behind by taking tools.  Seeing as how it took me two seasons to get more then one green or blue card built, by time winter rolled around I had 10-15 resources less then the other players since I only got 3 green cards out by then. I had to wait 10-20 minutes of hmms and haws while they decide their last moves which is a pretty terrible game design feature since you don't even get bonus points for filling your city up first or finishing winter first.  I really only gave it a 3/10 since the artwork is pleasant and it's a unique game even if it's designed very poorly. For a 1.5-2.5 hour worker placement game, I was really disappointed. Maybe if it played in 10-30 minutes I could accept the lack of luck mitigation and lopsided design choices, but for a longer game I don't find it acceptable to invest that much time into something you could be almost guaranteed to lose after the opening drawing of hands.",199792

336,ApocalypticRainbow,8,"A fantastically designed game which is fairly easy to learn while also being hard to master, Everdell has enough variance to keep the base game enjoyable for multiple playthroughs and works quite well at both the minimum and maximum player counts.   My favourite thing about Everdell is that it keeps it fairly simple and doesn't try to bloat itself with unnecessary mechanics for complexity, yet the game encourages you to think through each move that you would like to make, whether it would be the utilization of your workers to obtain resources or activate certain buildings, the set collection elements which allow you to fulfil contracts or claim monuments to add to your city, or even down to the combination of buildings and critter cards you construct in your city themselves.  Although repetitive playthroughs can eventually get stale, I feel like you will definitely get your money and entertainment's worth until it may be time to pick up an expansion.",199792

363,arcweldx,7,"Got this to play with my 7-year old. Cute animal theme with nice art and components and fairly simple rules make it a good introduction to worker placement and tableau building games. It's at the same complexity level as Stone Age but requires slightly less sophisticated strategy.  As a game for adults, it's like comfort food. Nothing surprising, fairly bland mechanics. It's a worker placement game where you're gathering resources that let you play building and character cards into your city tableau. There are combos particularly with building-character chains: building a particular building lets you play a particular character for free, 7 Wonders-style. There are shared goals to compete for such as ""have X number of Y type cards in your city"" or ""have X building and Y character"".  I like tableau building games as much as the next guy but tableau building is the death of player interaction. Everybody has their own display of cards with tiny writing that you will never be able to see across the table unless you get up and stand over their shoulder. Everybody is doing their own thing. There is meaningful competition: for the best worker spots, the race for the goals, the display of cards to purchase. But it's a very forgiving game. Unlike games like Agricola, where there is constant tension about getting worker spaces and it's easy to get locked out of actions with disastrous results, in Everdell you can basically always get the resources you need, it's just a question of how quickly and generously. Luck of the draw is particularly significant in this game because you are not just looking for cards that support general strategies, you are trying to get combos of two specific cards. This is mitigated somewhat by the ready availability of card drawing actions and the common market that increases your selection of cards beyond those in your hand.  This is a good one if you want high theme, attractive components, fairly low complexity and very forgiving, good variety in cards making for broad if not very deep game play.  I dislike the tree: it's fragile and was already broken by the 2nd play.",199792

Of course, you always end up feeling like you could have done so much more if only there were more room in you city, or if you had one more worker, or if that card had come out one turn earlier, or...! Always a good sign.   Looking forward to trying it with Pearlbrook.

The price is completely inadequate to the experience, although I understand that it's because of the large number of elements. It was also hard to control all the actions of each individual player, especially at the end of the game. The actions on the cards seemed unnecessarily complicated to me. This complication made no sense at times. The game itself is very nicely published, contains a lot of components, and is visually enjoyable.

How are people supposed to read that from far up in the tree? It's absurd. It's not as much a text size issue, but the choice of font. Tree should be an add-on and not the main way the game is produced.  Other than that, really cool engine builder. Will need more plays before I elaborate further.

BUT, since the board is ever-changing, you can also experience ap and downtime in the last part of the game. = For the most part, the rules fit the theme very well, so it's quite immersive and easy to explain to new players... BUT one mechanic can be very disturbing and throw you off the game : the fact that each player can be at a different ""season"" at the same time. - The set-up of the game is not awful but can take too much time for my taste, especially if you throw in some expansions. - Luck is an integrated part of the game. Just be aware, if it is something that bothers you. - It's the quintessential ""overproduced"" game, and therefore it's very expensive for the game it is (but not as much as a rip-off as the expansions). -- The expansions are empty boxes (they can literally all fit in one box) with some nice elements within. They clearly don't deserve the price they are sold for and the company (Starling) seems to have decided to milk the game to no end playing with the ""fan factor"".  Conclusion : Everdell is a good ""medium to heavy"" family game with gorgeous artworks and a welcoming design/theme, but suffers from the greed of its makers and the overhyped ""madness"" ;) of its fervent fans.  As a heavy ""Family Game"" : 7/10 (my rating would have been a little bit higher if not for the rip-off expansions. :( )",199792

491,a_traveler,7.3,"Initial rating, based on playing once. This appears early on to be a snowball engine worker placement game, but the snowball engine comes crashing down as it runs into the limit of the maximum number of cards you're allowed to play. Balancing that might make for an interesting exercise once you're fully aware of it, but for a first game, it did not make for a good experience.  The other reason I'm not very enthused about this game is the mix of cards. You can't rely on any card showing up, but you pretty much [i]need[/i] to be aware of all potential cards that could show up and keep space in your village for the strong (mostly purple prosperity) cards, as that's where you'll get by far the most points from. That basically means there's only one possible strategy for the game (points from events are nearly meaningless, as they cost a scarce action to acquire), which is pretty disappointing.  On the positive side, timing of passing is enjoyably meaningful due to freeing up forest spaces, and there's similarly interesting benefits to timing of card play. And of course, the illustrations, meeples and resources are extremely well done to set the scene.",199792

562,BathShiva,10,"I actually bought this one reluctantly because the mechanics looked boring and perhaps too similar to Viticulture (it's not). Spouse wanted it based on the woodland creature theme, so I bit the bullet and purchased the game. My initial reservations were completely off the mark. Everdell is now my favorite game. I’d compare the gameplay to crack. I just can’t get enough and always want more. PROS - The theme and artwork. - My first several plays, I was frustrated at how little I could accomplish with only two workers during season one. But over the course of more games, I grew confident that in the end everything would come together, and the city would be completely (or mostly) built, regardless of thwarted I felt in seasons one and two. Now I relax when it seems I’m treading water during season one and two. The way things come together in the latter half of the game seems magical. CONS - The forest locations have more influence on the gameplay than I’d prefer. They dictate whether a game is high scoring or really a slog. I wish they weren’t so influential. A small number of games came to a virtual standstill because there weren’t enough resources (such as berries) for the types of cards that cropped up (critters). - When one player finishes first, the is left twiddling their thumbs. The font on the cards is too small in places but I eventually memorized the cards so this is no longer an issue.",199792

566,Bayushi Sezaru,7.5,"I was very hesitant when I approached Everdell, for the very same reason that was drawing me to the game: the huge cardboard tree. I felt it was a marketing gimmick (as it definitely is), so I was afraid there was very little game behind it. When I finally decided to pull the trigger, I discovered how much wrong I was: the game has legs, and quite a lot.  Everdell is an admittedly lighter blend of worker placement and tableau building, two of my favorite game mechanics (after all, Race for the Galaxy and Agricola are still among the best in my gaming Valhalla).  The core of the game is the lots of small card combos players can build while they construct their tableaus. While the deck is huge (around the 130 cards mark) and most of the draws are blind from the top of the deck, the luck factor is mitigated by the fact that there are (variable amounts of) copies of each card, and by an ever present common pool of eight face up cards that every player can build as if in their hands.  Another unusual and clever feature is the ""out of sync"" that can happen between the seasons for different players: trying to be on a diverse ""seasonal trajectory"" can open playing opportunities that are normally more difficult to achieve...  The only nitpick I'd like to make is about the graphic design: while the game is undoubtedly very nice and charming to look at, the font used is very tiny and the details on the cards are not the easiest to tell apart. Perhaps the publisher could've balanced more the cuteness and readability factors?  Anyway, Everdell is a strong entry on the lighter side of serious gaming: it is enticing for every kind of player, and even in this regular edition it offers great value and replayability without feeling the need to add expansions.",199792

On the tasks, in the places, there are a lot of cards with text that should be remembered, because we want to actively use these cards and places. Access to the cards is made more difficult for more people. We have the cards at home, in the meadow in front of us, etc.. it's a disaster. This is not compensated by the gameplay, because despite the cards in the hand and on the board, randomness is very high. At the beginning you may have perfect cards, other people may be blocked, etc. Another disadvantage is the tree, which cannot be stored in the box after folding and unfolding, it breaks down after folding and unfolding, and above all, it is unnecessary, inconvenient/clunky, it adds nothing to the game and only gets in the way when something falls off it. There is no strategy here, this game is so random that even if you plan something at the beginning of the round, when it is your turn, there may be nothing left of your plans. The cards have changed, the fields have been occupied, if you wait for some related cards, they may never appear. This game supposedly requires thinking, but you can't plan anything, it's pure randomness. The game attracts attention, with a nice appearance and nice workmanship, that's all it takes, the inconvenience of the tree, random cards, problems with card handling, etc. I don't understand the phenomenon of this game at all. I think it might be the price. The game may be sold as a medium-sized, nicely made family game, at a good price, for people who do not pay much attention to randomness and are more focused on doing something with their family, even if it is unbalanced, random, etc..",199792

I get why some people like this, but the art/cuteness factor definitely plays a big part in this (and I'm also not fond of the art/production value) gameplaywise it is plain boring. No interesting decisions, everything comes down to getting the right cards and knowing which combo's there are. The fact that you play asynchronous while in real life shows what a MPS this is, the other players might as well not be there. 'But there is blocking of the worker placement spots'.

620,benreddic,7.5,"+ Looks very nice, components are good + The worker placement adds an interesting component, and depending on the forest locations can make the game more interesting - not much player interaction - Some cards are ""must plays"" (e.g crane, innkeeper, historian), and there are limited ways of scoring points meaning games tend to be decided by who drew the best cards - It is mostly random if you are able to complete the special events or not as each require 2 specific cards, and you may see none of them for the entire game: this means they are mostly luck based, and you rarely compete for them as you do with the basic events.

The take that cards seemed very out-of-place in this cute game and when played on the player who is not the current leader, it just seems to be a flaw in the game design. And even though most of the players at the table were new, I ended up sitting out many rounds and finishing my game long before others finished. For a short game, player elimination is ok. But with a longer medium weight game this just left a sour taste in my mouth after playing this saccharine looking game. Likely won't play this again but could be convinced.  3/16/22 update: https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/129029/take-and-positive-player-interaction this post mentions my same concern.

The artwork and the components elevates the gameplay, it is gorgeous and will have a good time playing as a result. Worker placement meets tableau building.

The components are also exquisite (how do you not put the berries in your mouth...?).   On your turn you can place one of your 2 (more in later seasons) workers to get resources/cards/points, play a card (paying for it with resources OR linking with an already played card), or bring all your people back and trigger the goodies that from from preparing for season.  Until I recently realized that you can play from your hand OR THE MEADOW, I thought this game was luck-based trash. But being able to play a card from a community area ramps up the interactivity and allows for you to more easily link cards to play combos to really take advantage of the many syntheses built into the cards.  This would be a 10, but: - It's still a little-luck based. Crushing combos can be dealt to someone's hand with no opportunity for retribution in the meadow. I think playing with fewer of the duplicate cards as a part of setup for a 2 player game, for example, would help clean up the fact that you don't need 5 (or whatever) farms in that game.",199792

Honestly, the retail version is just fine except having the additional KS content, with regards to the cards, would be missed. The gameplay is decent. It has bits from 7 Wonders, Imperial Settlers and various worker placement games. However, it doesn't replace some of the more tried and true worker placements. The card combos are a little too luck driven to me and specific. You are too often living off the top draws. A bit of a table hog. During the last season, you have so many various cards and pieces lying around, it gets to be a bit of a mess.",199792

Since some of the actions allow you to 'visit' cards of other players, it can be hard to see what is on another players card, even if they're sitting right beside you.

The base game is more than enough to keep you coming back for more, but the expansions do add more variety and complexity if you are looking to expand your Everdell collection. Recommended.",199792

Not too difficult to teach.  Theme and table presence give it the impression of being a very light and fluffy game but there's a lot going on here.  I really enjoy it with higher player counts and love that the expansion adds 5th and even 6th player.",199792
733,BlindWo1f,8,"While it initially underwhelmed me, the more I've played this the more I've enjoyed it. It's a nice worker placement game where every single worker, resource & card played counts, especially in the early game. I have 2 main issues though, sometimes the luck of the draw just isn't with you but is with your opponents. You draw a meadow card & bang the next player sees a crane there & it's theirs. There's nothing you can do about it & that's life. The other issue I have is the special event cards, it just feels luck based if you can get them & when you do they can tip a game towards that player which feels a little dissatisfying. ",199792

737,Blott,6,"So many symbols, so many words, so many cards.  The game isn't all that complicated, but it feels like it is high complexity because of all the different things on every single card you play.  There's so many little things that matter on the cards, and some can be very small text.  I can definitely see how they were structuring things so that players can easily understand card synergies, and with a group of gamers I could see this being extremely simple.  But Everdell is still out of the simple family game realm, which is a shame since it looks like a charming little game for everyone to enjoy.  The other problem with all the text and symbols on the cards is that there's a set of cards that sit on a tree which everyone's supposed to have access to, but since they are so hard to read from a distance, some people will struggle to see what is available.  Sure you can ask every time it's your turn, but no one wants to do that.  The end result is that the player who knows the cards best will always win.  I would gladly try Everdell again if someone asked, but I don't think it's one that needs to remain in my collection.",199792
738,BlueDi,9,"Gosto da evolução neste jogo. No Inverno (estação inicial) tem se a sensação de que ter 15 cartas na mesa é praticamente impossível alcançar. Mas, no Outono (estação final), já se está a mandar embora as cartas iniciais para substituir por cartas que valem mais pontos. É um jogo muito fluído, com regras e decisões simples e interessantes. É muito bonito e tem uma qualidade excepcional nos componentes. Contudo, o tamanho da letra nas cartas é desnecessariamente pequeno... Talvez com mais iconografia seria possível aumentar o tamanho nas cartas com mais texto, ou até aumentar o tamanho das cartas. Também tem a desvantagem de ocupar a mesa por completo. Ainda só joguei a 2 jogadores e a mesa fica cheia, com 4 jogadores, e a nova expansão permite 6 jogadores seria necessário 2 mesas e retirar a árvore e passar cartas para todos lerem o que fazem. Por isso, a meu ver, é um jogo ideal para 2 jogadores e talvez 3. A interacção entre os jogadores também é mínima, por isso não vejo interesse em jogar com mais de 3. Por outro lado, é um jogo completo. Existe a expansão Pearlbrook, Bellfaire, e Spirecrest mas este jogo não precisa de expansões. Há muita variabilidade nas cartas, nos objectivos, e nos recursos adicionais que é possível escolher de forma aleatória, sendo por isso um jogo interessante por si só.",199792

770,boardgamenerdvana,8,"Everdell is a very cute city building game about woodland critters that possesses a lot of depth and strategy.  Don’t be fooled by the cute artwork and critters, as this game is sure to get you thinking and give you quite the challenge.  —  First of all, the artwork and production in this game is stellar!   I love how the resources have been made in such a way that it resembles how it is in real life. The evertree also adds a nice and flavorful touch to the game.  —  Aside from the aesthetically awesome table appearance, the gameplay is really great as well.  Mechanics wise, Everdell is a worker placement, tableau building, and hand management game that offers tough choices each turn as workers are very limited and you need to structure your actions off to maximize the opportunities and not sit out during the later parts of the game when everybody else is still doing things.  —  What stood out in this game for me is the fact that not everybody would be in the same season as every one and not everybody ends the game at the same time.  How you progress through the seasons depends on how you optimize your worker placement actions and combo off card abilities to keep on doing more stuff.  It also provided a tense challenge in a sense everybody’s racing to go on events and fulfill common objectives for additional points.  One more thing I loved was the fact that you can build not only from your hand, but, from the meadow itself which is accessible to all players (which also provides tension in itself, as what you might need, won’t be there when you finally have the resources).  My only concern though, is that somebody is bound to just sit out during the later parts of the game if they finish doing their stuff early.  —  At 2p, it was a very close game, with my husband taking the win at 35-30.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️8/10⭐️⭐️⭐️",199792

783,bobbyrayiam,9,"This is a charming worker placement/tableau builder.  As others have mentioned, the artwork is exceptional and charming (it gives off a strong Wind in the Willows meets Narnia vibe).  The production is also fantastic with the Collector’s Edition also including metal point coins, wooden “occupied” tokens, another player type and meeples, as well as extra cards, a mini-expansion, and box sleeve.  The game is a good cross between a WP game and something like Imperial Settlers or Seasons.  Like the former, you are looking for synergies across cards, going diving for more cards, and acquiring resources to build your city.  Like the latter, you have seasons (although that’s about it other than card combos and impressive artwork).  Like any other card-based game, luck will play a factor.  In addition, the cardboard tree isn’t great for 4 players and the twigs roll.  These minor complaints don’t really taint the game for me at all, however.  It plays in about 30-60 minutes (2-3 players) and provides a genuinely satisfying experience in an enjoyable world.",199792

The constraint on city size really hurts - I hit the 15 card limit at the end of the Summer season and spent the last quarter of the game just converting cards into coins.  It was disappointing not to be able to continue to play the game and use my abilities/cards.  The text and icons on the cards are very small as well, difficult to read from across the table.  The entire game felt reactionary rather than proactive - you're trying to find ways to use the cards you've been dealt.  Not sure yet if you can plan and execute a strategy.  I didn't see a way to flush the Meadow cards or delve deeper into the draw deck for the cards you want.",199792

797,bolobaby,6,"This game is not bad, but not great either. It is a generally non-competitive. You focus on your own engine, with little real ability to impact what your opponent is up to.

Negatives Card draws may heavily favor one player over another, due to Construction/Critter combos and Special Events requiring specific pairings of cards.  There are loads of spaces to send your workers and a lot of them are very similar so there is barely any competition for spaces.   It's best to play as a fun, relaxing game and see who wins at the end, rather than to play it super competitively.

801,BoneAlone,8,"+ Theme and art is so charming. Does feel like a little fantasy world full of forest critters. + Not sure how important the tree is because you could probably play it without, but it's a nice touch. It also makes the game stand out as ""that one with the big tree on it"".  + Rewarding when you get your engine up and running. We had so many turns in which we didn't place a Meeple on the board and just let the cards bounce off one another. The Spring season is quite short as you are trying to build up resources which may feel like a bit of a waste. Summer and Autumn is where it picks up.  + Set up is surprisingly easy.  + You are never just limited to your hand as you also have the 8 cards in the meadow to pick from.  + Several ways to score points.  + It's hard to tell who is winning as the points all get calculated at the end. For example, we were both adamant I would win as I had the most points/coins on the table but I actually lost. At least it keeps you guessing.  + Your town and hand are limited so you have to think carefully about what you play as it can be difficult to remove/replace cards without the right actions. This gives a decent amount of strategy rather than just placing everything.  + The components are nice and the berries are so satisfying to squish!  + Doesn't feel long as you all eventually run out of turns.   - It can take a few games to get used to the mechanics. We definitely missed out on a few opportunities in our first game but were more clued up after that. The rules aren't that bad, it's just that there's so many cards, effects and abilities that it can be a bit hard to grasp right off the bat.  - The turns are quite short as you only get one action. However, there can be some downtime if a player hasn't had a chance to plan their next action yet as their turn came around so quickly. You can even finish the game before everyone else so there could also be downtime here too.",199792

Instead of every stretch goal adding months of design, testing and production time as well as shipping cost and storage space (Myth, Rum and Bones, I'm looking at you), this one added better components and arrived six months early.   The slipcase and box are exquisite, the board and tree great, and the upgraded components are really awesome. There are only two flaws in the physical game: the twigs roll and the cards are a little thin (compared to, say, Race for the Galaxy).  The game itself is compelling and interesting. As others have pointed out, it's liek a cross between 7 Wonders, Race for the Galaxy, and some worker placement games I've not played. There's loads to do and you never feel bored. It takes a while to get the feel for the vaying values of things (card draw, resources, VP), and the changeable forest cards plus special events give a slightly different game each time. The theme is DISGUSTINGLY well-integrated, so much so that it adds to the enjoyment of the game in no small way.  I especially appreciate the fact turns are not limited - it's a nice twist that means timing, rather than time, matters a lot. You still do a lot of arithmetic to figure out how to get the most out of any card, but there's the added bonus of lost worker actions for events, and reading your opponents' tableaux to see if you can hold off claiming them for one more turn or one more season.  Extremely happy with this purchase.",199792

It is very pleasant to develop your city over the course of 3 seasons. The artwork is gorgeous and the theme really appeals to me. Compared to Meadow, it's a very different game and I'm confident Everdell, currently rated at 8 after 2 plays, will get a higher rate from me, after more plays.   I am a bit ""concerned"" about the replayability of the base game without expansions (especially Mistwood for solo play). Most cards contained in the main deck are duplicated 3 or 4 times. The variability between games, with the base game only, seems to come from the objective cards allowing additional point scoring and even then, there is a limited card pool. The expansion(s) probably address that variability ""issue"". With that being said, I am convinced the base game is enough to provide at least 50+ hours of fun.  Meadow (even without the expansion) seems to offer more variability in the cards seen over the course of several plays. Every card is different.",199792

831,BowlofBGG,9,"Things to note: Average player count I played at - 3 Number of plays at time of review - 7 win/lost - 4/3  So let me lead with I did not buy this game for several years because all I ever saw was the big cardboard/wooden tree everywhere I saw it and thought it was tacky, unneeded and trying to pull you in with a gimmick. Which the trees is the thing that pulls the most people in initially to get a closer look. Even when my then Girlfriend (now fiancée) would ask for us to buy it, I sat on the fence. That was till the Complete Collection was on kickstarter and showed up on BGG post and I thought if I ever was to jump in, now was the time. I quickly got my hands on a copy and played a learning game and 2 games, then decided to go all in on the Complete collection within a 2 week time frame. FOMO did play a part in that, however after more plays I think this is a game worth owning, and a lot of the expansions are held highly from what I hear. So I am very excited to give them a whirl when they all arrive in the mail.  So back to the review and the ""Evertree"" that is designed to stand in the middle of every game. I still stand by my initial reaction to the tree, its a gimmick meant to pull people in. The components in this game are some of the best I have experienced in board games in terms of design, a lot of them I just want to play with all the time. Even the board itself and the cards are high quality, the tree that comes with the game is very nice quality as well. While the tree is not too bad to setup, it will start to get damaged depending on how many plays it gets and delicate you are with it. But its unneeded and not functional. It does have a tracker, you don't have to set it up to use the tracker, and after 2-3 games you don't need the tracker anymore as its very rudimentary tracker. The tree is a knock over danger to an extent, it will sit far back on the board and out of the way from players, to help eliminate the knock over factor. Since the goal cards that sit on it have small text and sit far back(even on a small table), no one can really read them. I have found these cards move off the tree (if they even make it there in the first place), sit closer to the players and are often passed around. The tree, while ""cool"", is a total gimmick and I really I will never set it up again unless showing the game to someone new.  let me highlight again, small text does exist in the game that totally has the option to take up more space without sacrificing art work. This issue will lead to a lot of passing of cards until people are familiar with the game.  The game is covered in great art work, with clever images of the little critters hidden in each of the city building images that the critters synergies with. The theme is all over this, and Redwall fans or other people fond of other anamorphic media (charlottes web, warriors, etc) will find this theme a joy.  The theme of the game is relatively deceptive to what it has in gameplay. I have found a lot of new comers approaching the game with a carefree attitude expecting a simple shallow game. That is not the case, I have found that grasping the fundamentals of the game comes only not till the end of the first game, if not even till the 2nd game. Which can be off putting to the game. Then the gameplay depth sets in the 2nd game and continues on. The game all boils down to combing cards to build your own tableau and trying to make the most effective tableau to bring you points. Sounds simple but seeing all the cards took me 3 games, and to even get access to play all the cards took me 5 games. The card pool of the base game is made up of 30+ different cards with each having four copies. This means the biggest part of setup is shuffling a 120+ cards  I think this game is really fun because the fundamentals are simple, and the game is more a Eurogame with your own little world you exist in with limited player interaction over worker placement.  You can play this game more aggressive and playing against your opponent, but even then those games if you push to far then you are doomed to loose due to lack of ability to play out your city (tableau). My point is you can play this game with a wide range of people that makes it accessible and fun for all, while also offering great depth to those that wish to pursue that.  The game as well as having a large card pool that offers great replayability, has a mechanic that some of the worker placement locations change up every game (called forest locations) and the special goals change every game. The different forest locations every game really helps set the tone the game will have, some games will be super easy to cycle the deck (or super hard), other games certain resources will be super easy to get.   Their is some RNG to the game, that can effect your likely hood of winning, but the meadow (a free area that has 8 cards anyone can play from that cycle out) does help mitigate this issue as well as helps balance play pace. I have found while RNG can be a factor, it does not necessarily mean you will lose.  While the meadow is not a revolution or a unheard of game mechanic, is is a good one for this game. Their is another great mechanic with how the round ends, as when you are ready to go to the next round, you do, but not every one progress at the same time. This opens alot of interesting interactions with the worker placement areas. Also it allows people to combo out certain cards, or certain effects will proc with the round end that opens up other interesting interactions.  All in all I think this is a great game that will make it to my table for years to come because of its quick time to play and all the great things it brings to the table. While I would say this game does not have really any failings it does have drawbacks. Some of this are just things that exist because of the design that cannot be removed, but it does make you wonder about how great the game really is.",199792

839,BradJacobs,7.5,"Everdell is... not my kind of game. It has some euro interaction, but otherwise it can feel similar to Terraforming Mars.. which is a game I don't particularly enjoy. But, at least is not a cube pusher.  Things to like: - The production is amazing - The artwork is also phenomenal - The family likes it - The worker retrieval at different times makes for interesting timing decisions - How the game scales up is interesting - Works well at 2p  Things that are meh or not so good: - Theme is cute but otherwise unappealing - Interaction is on the lower side - A lot of reading to do - You need to remember a lot of things that will trigger on your turn or when you take certain actions, easy to miss - There's no endgame! Some people finish earlier than others and the game doesn't build up to an electric finale.  Having said that, I think that there's a lot to like here in terms of design. It's a solid game and it's enjoyable to play. It's a good family game and it doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't feel random and it's satisfying to play at any player count (though I'd encourage players to think about their turn ahead of time).  If only there was more interaction, I'd rate this higher. If I enjoyed more tableau building mechanics, I'd rate this higher",199792

841,BrainBursta,6,Lots of card text. Players have to constantly read new cards and memorize different combos. This makes the game feel heavier than what it offers.  With better iconography and some streamlining this game would have been great.  Now it's just OK.,199792
842,braktheitalian,7,"Only tried 4P and the game seemed to drag. The components and cards are excellent. Card effects are interesting. The competitive worker placement feels thematically appropriate to the setting.  The only thing I didn't like about this game was calling the phases ""seasons"" - because in a single game, the seasons don't repeat at all. Also, the seasons are not globally applicable, which feels weird. It seems to me that a season is related to weather and time which apply synchronously. So I would have preferred to call the seasons chapters or generations - implying sequence without synchronicity.  Anyway, the tableau building is fun when synergies can be acquired. At 4 players, there was not enough opportunity to acquire synergistic cards. So I felt like player agency was rather limited - like racing with limps instead of at full speed.  I would like to play again with only 3 players to compare. At 4 players, I prefer Viticulture for a similar FEEL (though the tableau building is much more expansive in Everdell).",199792

From what I remember, it's just a really nice tableau-builder with fun combos you can pull off when you match the critter with the building. You have a ridiculously small amount of workers at the beginning (2), which makes each decision critical as you start the game. Eventually, it quickly snowballs as you get more workers and your buildings start producing. I like the fact that not all players finish at the same time, and that it usually depends on how well they played. It might not always be the case, but the longer you play, the stronger your engine is, and that results in more victory points.",199792

Some randomness          Fun Factor: at the beginning of the first game it was after that and the next games it was not.  Thoughts:  I have not played this since late 2018 and early 2019. The game components are high quality.  The tree seemed to get in the way depending on where you were sitting.  The card print is small and can be hard to read.  For a fair amount of the cards, we had discussions over what they meant and we had to check the rules.  Then for several, we had to check boardgamegeek. Even during the last game I played, this still happened.   For 3 of the games, it wasn't possible for us to catch the leader.  2 of the games, a player got to 15 buildings in the 2nd to last season.  Both times, they really couldn't do much that would impact scoring.  In fact one of the times during the final season, the one player really couldn't do anything.    Some of what happened there is that a player or players were in the final season when the player was still in the 2nd to last season.  These players in the final season (or are ahead in Seasons) can take what those players need.  This caused those players in earlier seasons to try to change strategy but it wasn't possible since it was late in the game. For these players, this left a bad taste in their mouth for they felt they wasted time.  On the flip side, this strategy (being in seasons ahead and taking cards that are essential to other players but not really needed by you) was used in 2 of the games to effectively slow the leader down which caused the leaders at the time to not to win.    This game has all mechanics that I like.  It is multiplayer solitaire which has been popular for quite some.  My issue here is that a wrench can be thrown into your engine that can be hard to correct to impossible.    On my buy, borrow, bury rating scale, I would say that this is a bury.  I am giving it 4.5 after 5 play through.  As the 4 rating says on BoardGameGeek ""Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.""

However, don't be fooled: its not easy and it takes a lot of planning! You play over four seasons, where the first one is a breeze, and the last one takes a while. However, the game doesn't really outstay it's welcome (at least the base game).  In this game you build a 3*5=15 Tableau. I was afraid that it would get the ""Imperial Settlers"" effect where everything co-triggers and connects and becomes tedious to track, however this is certainly not the case. Each card has small effects, and it's mostly just points. However, the real game is in planning and racing for special events and collecting certain cards, which makes it great, since you always have an eye on your opponent.  I particularly like that you manage to build your 15 cards quite fast, to the point that it's a problem since you can't really replace them! So at the beginning you want to build an engine fast, but already at 2/3 you have to think it well. I really like this balancing.  On the negative side: the cards have significant text, and you have to read them. There is significant luck of the draw, since some cards are better than others, but in practice you do see a bunch of cards thanks to the common market (which is not the case in Tapestry or Wingspan), so it didn't bother me.  However, ultimately, I think the biggest problem is that the first rounds of the game are all a bit samey, since you always have to go for the green cards first. However the last two rounds are very different each time. I guess this could have an expansion like ""Terraforming Mars: prelude"", where you just skip the first round but get some fixed income. That'd make the game faster and better! On the other hand, I do think that after 10 plays, you'll really need an expansion, otherwise the whole game will be also pretty samey.  I haven't tried expansions, but I really wish there was one where you just change the whole deck and get a different feel (like Ora etc Labora), instead of just adding more stuff.  Anyway, this is really a top tableau builder, much better than any of the ones from Portal Games. However I still think that race for the galaxy and san juan are better, because they are more portable, and play quicker. I also like Tapestry more, but just because of the tetris puzzle.",199792

The beginning of the game can seem slow, and in some cases it may even feel like you are doing something wrong, but the early game is intentionally built in this way to help create an exponential feeling of growth. What starts as a slow ""first season"" will quickly evolve to a complex ""final season"" where every turn you are doing another action from something else you have done before.  Bonus points: Furries.  Other Bonus Points: The expansions can create some interesting challenges or additions to the normal gameplay, which is exactly what one wants from an expansion. They can either add new challenges for the experienced or exciting boons for the new.  More Bonus Points: The art is just straight up gorgeous.

1025,Carothia,8,"I've seen other comments say very relevant things about the game that I shall repeat for emphasis.  - The start of the game feels very very slow. Since a big part of the game is worker placement to get resource to build buildings, they need you to start with 0 resources, but every building costs so much that it takes at least 2 turns to be able to build the cheapest buildings. This is if no one else at the table is trying to block you with their workers, which can lead to no card being played for a full season. That being said, once you can put cards down, it does feel really rewarding to combo critters and buildings and their effects.  -The game is intimidating if you're used to more ""casual"" gameplay with a lot of rules to assimilate at first, but once you give it a good read, everything feels quite natural.  -It looks lovely, it feels whimsical and the texture on the resource is a nice touch. I don't regret buying it or playing it.  -The solo mode is challenging and offers different difficulty, which is cool enough to mention as well.",199792

1032,cascadings,3,"Wow, I really thought I was gonna like this one. I was even gonna order the complete collection! But I've played it a few times and I'm really scratching my head at some of the design decisions here.   Unlike Wingspan where you start with a ton of actions and slowly pare them down, in Everdell your first season feels like total shit. Like, it's so easy to not get a single satisfying combo at the start due to the limited actions/card selection, and the bonus production at the end of spring means that someone can easily get a much better ""engine"" just from getting lucky with their beginner hand. There's nothing satisfying at all about starting with nothing.  Then, by the time it's the last turn, you're probably drowning in resources but you have no room in your tableau, or you're too split between using your workers to grab the special events or spend your useless resources. The struggle doesn't feel like a GOOD decision struggle though. It's just unsatisfying. Aiming for the special events in the first place is a total crapshoot, especially solo or with lower player counts where you'll just never see the right cards.  The card art is so lovely and I love the idea of playing the critter for free when you play their matching building. However the board design is an awful cumbersome waste of space. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to assemble the god damn ever tree without wearing down the cardboard everywhere, and EVERY TIME I try to open the massive game board, it starts to split at the hinges because of how poorly the weight is distributed (or something). WHY IS IT SO BIG??? It's so inelegant compared to something like Parks (or yes Wingspan again). For a game that works much better with more people the amount of uneccessary table space this takes is atrocious. I don't even want to think about the expansions.  I'm sad I don't like it because the art is so wonderful, but err at least the publisher sounds like a total scam artist I guess?  What I'd recommend instead for the entry-level mechanics mishmash here: Card play and engine building: Wingspan (not amazing, but better than Everdell and more accessible, YEAH I SAID BETTER FITE ME), Terraforming Mars (not as accessible, ugly ass cards but much more satisfying engine building) Worker placement: Parks",199792

Und dann waren da ja noch die ganzen Erweiterungen, die das Spiel, theoretisch, auch für mich attraktiver machen konnten.   Nun ist es aber endgültig Zeit, getrennte Wege zu gehen: Ständig nur darauf zu achten, ob man ein passendes Paar Karten hat, nervt genauso, wie das Auszählen der Punkte am Ende. Viele Texte sind zu klein, um am Tisch ergonomisch angeordnet zu werden. Wenn man es nicht regelmäßig spielt, muß man immer wieder irgendwelche Details in den Regeln nachlesen – und ohne Spirecrest will ich es eigentlich gar nicht mehr spielen, mit aber auch nicht (mehr dort).

I often find myself worrying more about card names (which I have no control over) than just enjoying the combos of what's available.   But as a light, tactical game with fun card combos, this is pretty fun. Unfortunately, Pearlbrook isn't the best expansion (and in fact makes the game even more arbitrary with the river cards).

1060,Ccast291,7,"This fills the same place as Wingspan for me. It provides a light and enjoyable experience that is a feast for the eyes. The gameplay is well thought out and it is satisfying to pull different levers and see what card combos work well.   My only real knock on the game is that, like its winged cousin, it is almost too polished. It seems like the scores are always very close despite the paths and cards chosen. This adds tension to see who played best but, it also makes it seem like the choices made carry less weight.  The other downside is that the game can end at different times for different people. If I maximize every turn and my opponent makes some mistakes, I can can keep playing several turns longer than they can. This is rather boring for the player who isn't playing and is like beating a dead horse for the player still playing. ",199792

The following day we played Everdell 3 times and are hooked.   Our only complaint is we feel like we dont have enough playtime/access to resources to really develop/complete our cities.  The first seasons feels VERY limiting if you don't get to play a farm or other resource generator prior to the first production runs.  Just ordered the Bellfaire expansion to aid in allowing access to more resources, making some events easier to achieve and addition of powers to add some abilities despite removing a worker.    I also ordered the Spirecrest expansion in the hopes that it enhances what we like while adding some more challenges.  I can see Everdell getting to the table every week.",199792

1086,cfarrell,7,"This had gotten some good buzz, so it’s been on the bubble for me for a bit: interested in trying, but an easy decision not to buy. So I’m late to the party. I must admit I was a bit surprised at how derivative it is: it’s really just very lightly warmed over 51st State: Master Set. It plays almost the same, with just some additional chrome and generally bigger and longer (the latter two: not features). I think the other thing that surprised me a bit was that the game could really obviously benefit from some sort of phasing to the huge draw deck, and early/late set of cards or something, and the fact that it doesn’t do this can be a big problem for both the early game (where it’s a big benefit just to draw a bunch of bootstrap cards rather than scoring cards) and the late game (when those bootstrap cards then clutter the market and dramatically reduce choices). So it’s surprising, and telling, that this (or something that would serve that function) was not done. Anyway, if you’re a hobbyist and haven’t played Imperial Settlers/51st State Master Set, it’s worth playing, but it many of the same flaws of those previous games that kept them off the table for me (Everdell is better than IS, not as good as 51stMS). However, my general feeling is that Everdell is just far too derivative to really justify existing in the hobbyist space. 51st State Master Set should really have a “reimplemented by” link.  Also, the 40-80min playing time estimate is absurd. It’ll come down with experience obviously, but budget 90m minimum with 4 and playing for the first time.  Speaking of absurd things, the fact that this is #6 on BGG in the Family Games category is absurd. This is clearly a hobbyist game. You can play it with your gamer teens, but that doesn’t make it a family game.",199792

1097,chadmoores1988,8,One of my wife's favorite worker placement games and our introduction to that type of game play.  I find that as the game goes on you can really get a good strategy going and find yourself with a bunch of useful resources.  Something i don't love of worker placement games is i find that getting resources can be dull and only get a little in every round.  I enjoy finding a strategy that can make me fruitful and able to pick up many items and abilities.  This game unlike most worker placement has a great balance where you can find yourself rich with some things but not so much that you broke the game and clearly going to win which isn't fun for most people.

I really enjoyed the variety of combos possible between the cards and the random objectives each game to keep it fresh. Production is out of this world even though the tree and the number of cards you need to read on the meadow becomes problematic with more than 3 players. The game can get a bit swingy due to the randomness of the cards which can affect your ability to chain a lot of cards together.

Achieving certain card combinations and chains is essentially luck of the draw, and if a player is lucky enough to get certain card combinations early enough it is massively better than late game. All the card abilities can also start to feel a bit fiddly towards late game, there was constant revisiting of each card in our game because of uncertainties and to see what triggers, with 4 players that can slow the game down.   There were some bright spots. I did really like how each player could be further along in a season than another player. The artwork, components, and game look really good. The game wasn’t bad but it didn’t feel great either. I would rather play Imperial Settlers as it will satisfy the same itch and play quicker .

After a few plays it's much easier to try and work out a strategy and it's genuine fun trying to build those combos, or get those free critters to build your city.

However, you can also play production cards which trigger when played and up to 2 other times during the course of the game so you can get resources that way too. Besides these production cards there are 4 other types pf cards (instant, additional placement spots, ongoing abilities, and end game scoring) so at least after one play I feel there are a few different ways you can take your strategy throughout the course of the game.   Beyond the cards, there are 4 worker placement spaces that are variable per game along with 4 special events that can be activated based on certain card combos, which does help the replayability as in a 4p game you're likely to see the entire deck over the course of the game.

Typical modern euro popular on BGG at the moment: too long, too complex, too fiddly, too many random cards, not enough player interaction. The various tiny fonts on cards where you need to read them from across the table is ridiculous. Fool looked like a particularly unfun game-ruining card to me: a single take-that card that played on an opponent could potentially take them from first place to last place in a 2-hour long 4 player game with nothing they could potentially do (unless they were lucky enough to have already played the University or Dungeon cards that can counter it).",199792

Each game feels unique as there are different combinations of forest and special events each time you play. Meaning, a strategy in one game may be good, but ineffective in the very next game. The components are beautiful and the art makes it feel very immersive. My biggest complaints are somewhat nit picky:  1. The Tree - It's actually great but as you assemble and disassemble it, the tree will start to wear at the corners.  2. Forest Actions - We kind of feel like they should be slightly weaker than they are. Some of them are just heads and tails better than the basic actions to the point where all the players just race to fill them and deny them to their opponents. It's actually the element I like the least about the game.  3. Open Signs - The game is a table hog and can make it difficult to tell if someone has an open card on their board without knowing the cards. We 3D printed signs for this and solved our problem, but it would have been helpful if something was included in the box.",199792

Don't let its good looks fool you. There's a whip-smart game here, one that really rewards clever play ... perhaps TOO much.  See, ""Everdell"" is one of those games that really wants to be played with a group of equally competent players. If you've got that group, you're golden. Go play this game right now. It's awesome.  But if you don't - if one player is significantly keener or more green than the others - you've perhaps got a problem. Because ""Everdell"" is a strange game. It lets you advance through the games four stages at your pace, and when you've finished stage 4, well, you're done. What's that? Your clever friend has been biding his time, pulling off combo after combo, and so he's still in stage 2? Tough luck, friend. Grab a drink, kick up your heels, cause you're going to be watching the rest of the way.  That's a significant ding on what's otherwise a fantastic game. I'd love to see some way for players who wrap up their game early to keep some skin in the game. As it stands, it's a tough game to recommend because a.) it's tougher than it looks (expect some AP your first few games), and b.) the aforementioned brutality it shows to players on the learner end of an experience gap.  But will I still play ""Everdell""? Oh, hell yes. Didn't I say this game is awesome? Heck if I'm going to let that rough edge at the end put me off so clever a game!  Box signed by game's designer.

No these games are not hugely similar however the satisfaction i get from this game is on par with Terraforming Mars.  The card combos are a joy to discover and the engine you can build is so satisfying manipulate and use.  The 5 ""tags"" on the Everdell cards remind me of how tags in Terraforming Mars help players understand the different cards functions. .  This game is the full package and plays in about half the time Terraforming Mars takes.

1350,Cstranger,9,"This is a great worker placement/card collecting game. The art and design of the components are amazing and I have enjoyed every play so far. It definitely draws your eye as you see it set up on a table, especially with the tree setup.  The way the game works is that it has 4 seasons (rounds) that make up the whole game. In each of those seasons you gain additional workers so you have the ability to do more things per round. It is sort of like an engine builder as well since the cards you are purchasing are being built to get put in your city to gain rewards. The city only has 15 spots so you have to choose wisely. The beginning of the game moves slow since you have so few workers and abilities but then it ramps up near the end when you are trying to get the most victory points.  I love this game and will be sleeving it so that it will last many more plays into the future!",199792

The best part of the game is that you start small, but then the combos and chain reactions snowball towards the end of the game. However, although chaining combos are good, the engine building is not satisfactory in a way that you barely start building any production and then almost immediately need to refocus on converting resources to points. On top of that, you can't always have the chains you want/plan because the cards necessary may simply never show up in the meadow or can be taken by opponents, resulting in not satisfactory game flow.  Expansions do not fix the core gameplay, only expand it.  Only works well with 3p.",199792

1490,dboyee,8,"Everdell is a super cute little critter game for 1-4 players.  The components are superb.  I love the realistic resource bits (i.e. the little rubber round berries, the bundle-shaped wooden twigs, the gem-shaped resin, and the flat stones).  The artwork on the cards is very nice and the Ever Tree tops it off as a nice show piece.  The game mechanism is worker placement and card tableau building.  I love how the cards can combo and build off of one another (similar to the game 7 Wonders).  My main gripe with the game is its length.  While the game is quite easy to learn, there is a lot going on in it.  On your turn, you are trying to decide which cards you should purchase and consider the best possible ways to combo your cards together.  This very much causes the game turns to drag on and increase the game length.  I enjoyed the theme of the game and all the beautiful components (including the animal-shaped meeples) that helped bring this game to life.  It was a fun experience to play and I wanted to play again to explore further card combinations.  8 out of 10 ",199792

1512,debelbot,5,"TL;DR: I was expecting more... I really dislike the ""style over substance"" design philosophy behind the game.  In theory this game should be right up my alley. I am a sucker for card-driven engine building mixed with worker placement, but...  The game starts off very slow, it's very luck dependent and the text on the cards is too small and many times not explained well enough. Important information is almost illegible..  Neither the tableau building nor the worker placement feel really satisfying.  The card effects are very situational, yes you can chain cards, but you'd end up with a patchwork tableau that doesn't really score. There are some end game scoring cards, but good luck (litterally) getting them when you need them. There are very few real engine building effects (court house, judge).  The worker placement spots are just boring, although I like the variable forest locations. The way you get your workers back and how the rounds end at different times for different players is ok, until you basically wait 30 minutes for someone to finish the game.  The goals - meh, the basic ones are ok, but the variable ones are a pure luck fest.  I also really dislike the massive number of big box expansions. Just feels like a cash grab. No, thanks...  The art is good, but the graphic design leaves a lot to be desired.",199792

Komponenty jsou skvěle provedený, na stole to vypadá perfektně, pravidla se dají vysvětlit během 5 minut a partie ve dvou odehrát do půl hodiny, jen to teda určitě není oddechovka, spíš cvičení kombinatoriky a neustálý přemýšlení o tři tahy dopředu.

1516,deedw,9,"„Everdell“ war neben „Discover“ eines der Spiele, über die im Vorfeld am meisten berichtet wurde. Zumindest fühlte es sich so an. Schade war, dass es wir in Essen keine Chance hatten, einen freien Tisch zu ergattern. Umso schöner, dass es Stuttgart jemand dabei hatte.  In Everdell baut jeder Spieler mit Karten ein kleines Dorf im Wald auf, in der dann Fuchs, Lurch und Eule gemeinsam wohnen. Vom Prinzip her handelt es sich um ein Arbeiter-Einsetzspiel. Die Besonderheit ist, dass man sehr wenig Arbeiter hat und auch nur drei Runden spielt, wo man diese einsetzen kann. Das Mehr an Spiel erhält man dadurch, dass man Handkarten hat, welche mit Ressourcen ausgespielt werden können – auch ohne Arbeiter zu haben. Zusätzlich ergänzen sich die Handkarten, denn in einmal gebaute Häuser können bestimmte Tiere kostenlos einziehen. Ein bisschen erinnert das an „7 Wonders“, wo man bestimmte Gebäude kostenlos bauen darf, wenn man das Vorgängergebäude bereits gebaut hat. Diese Jagd nach sich ergänzenden Karten funktioniert bei „7 Wonders” und ebenso gut bei „Everdell“.  Grafisch ist „Everdell“ bombastisch. Die Illustration von Andrew Bosley ist großartig. Ich fühlte mich richtig wohl in meinem Dörfchen und es war mir wichtig, welche Tiere einziehen. Ebenso ist das Spielmaterial sehr gut. Die Beeren sind aus Gummi und hüpfen toll (sogenannte Gummibären), Stein und Harz ist auch klasse. Nur beim Holz hätte der Designer auf runde Plastikbaumstämme verzichten sollen, da diese ständig vom Brett rollten.  Hingucker ist natürlich auch der dreidimensionale Baum, auf dem neben den restlichen Arbeitern, die man in den drei von vier Jahreszeiten freischalten kann, auch bestimmte Zielkarten liegen. Unter dem Baum, im Stamm sozusagen, liegen die Karten, welche die Spieler nachziehen dürfen. Und so toll der Baum aussieht, so unnütz ist er auch. Zum einen muss der ein oder andere Spieler immer um den Baum greifen, um Karten zu ziehen. Daneben sieht man nicht alle Ziele, die ausliegen. Noch schlimmer ist, dass der Baum in unserer Runde meine Karten verdeckt und so mein Mitspieler schräg gegenüber keine Chance hatte, zu erkennen, was ich in der Auslage hatte. Wenn ich das Spiel besitzen würde, wäre der Baum wohl das, was ich lieber separat flach auf den Tisch legen würde.  Wenn man hinter die Fassade der großartigen Grafik und tollen Komponenten blickt, bleibt glücklicherweise auch noch ein gutes Spiel zurück. Die Interaktion hielt sich zwar in Grenzen, aber das habe ich auch nicht erwartet. Natürlich besetzt man mitunter ein Feld, welches ein andere Spieler gerne nutzen würde, aber meist hatten wir genügend alternative Wahlmöglichkeiten für Aktionsfelder. Die andere Interaktionsmöglichkeit ist es, bestimmte „offene“ Orte der Mitspieler zu nutzen. Aber auch hiervon gibt es nicht extrem viele. Wie gesagt, stört das aber nicht, es macht einfach auch so Spaß, sein Dorf aufzubauen. Vor allem eine gute Engine aufzubauen, sodass man mit seinen vier Arbeitern in der letzter Runde doch noch wesentlich mehr Aktionen durch das Ausspielen von Karten nutzen kann.  Einziger Kritikpunkt, den ich habe, ist die fehlende Übersicht. Vor jedem Spieler liegen am Spielende 15 Karten, die mitunter miteinander interagieren können. Hier die Übersicht nicht zu verlieren, will gelernt sein – was man aber vermutlich mit mehr Partien sicherlich irgendwann beherrscht, da es nur fünf unterschiedliche Kartentypen gibt. Ich freue mich auf die deutsche Version, wo auch immer diese erscheinen wird.",199792

1585,Dflo,9,"6+ plays  A delightful worker placement board game with a mid-range of complexity and strategy. It's light hearted, the artwork is beautiful and the pieces are top quality.  Gameplay: You place about 15 workers per game, which give you a lot of resources and things to do. Each player gets 1 action per turn which introduces unique challenges when placing your workers or playing cards to your city. Later in the game the amount of worker placements keeps going up, giving each player more choices and strategies.  The Evertree you construct is a little cumbersome to deal with, and makes it difficult to see each special event card available and can get in the way of other pieces. Some cards have a worker placement space where your opponents can use (as well as yourself). However, it's difficult to see who has what when you're at the table and it's very easy to lose track.

This seems like a negative review but I really enjoy the game these were just some issues I found with it. If everyone is of similar skill level this will be crazy competitive",199792

1639,djberg96,6,"Played a few games on Steam, eh, it's ok. It's certainly a pleasant looking and pleasantly themed game (and I hear the physical copy has a cool little tree). Essentially, it's an action selection + tableau building game with some bonus interactions between buildings and specific critters.  I do think there's a decent game here, and deciding whether or not to simply collect resources directly or dump potentially valuable cards adds at least a little angst for the players. Getting free critters with the right buildings is nice, but may not line up with your overall strategy. And, as many others have pointed out, there's some definite luck of the draw and having some experience with the combos will probably be a decisive advantage.  In the end, I think this is yet another game for sensitive souls who abhor direct conflict or historical guilt of any sort (though there is one card you can use to mess with other players), are looking for something relatively light, and want to admire the artwork. I think if you like games like [i]Lost Ruins of Arnak[/i] then you will probably enjoy this.  So, for me a decent game to kill the time once in a while, but didn't really grip me.",199792

The story is about leaving Everdell to build a new city, so in theory there would be luck on what resources can be found in the wild, who would want to leave Everdell to live in your city, etc.    I can imagine the game growing on me more as I play it more.

1679,dold_,6,"Messing with a borrowed copy, so far it's not to my taste. The worker placement is very vanilla, mostly used as a wrapper to make turn order matter a little and distribute resources. The card play has some elements that I don't really care for. The bonuses for getting matching buildings/critters is cool in theory, but the way the cards are distributed makes it a bit unsatisfactory. The things the cards do are pretty plain as well. There are a ton of cards to cross reference at the start as well - 5+ cards at start, plus 8 cards in the middle that are up for grabs.  Elements that I'm more curious to explore are the more frequent effects of ""give stuff to opponents instead of discarding it"", and forgoing resource collection and going for point heavy tableaus from game start.  Edit 3/2021: Pretty inoffensive, but I don't have much desire to play more of it. Everdell is something I could call a ""zen"" game: it's very much in my wheelhouse, but it's not something I put much energy into playing well. Part of the reason is simply because I've played a lot of this kind of game, I end up ""going through the motions"", as there isn't really anything that grips me outside of doing actions I generally like to take in games (such as playing lots of cards).",199792

The artwork is amazing and the components are also really well designed and frankly are something you would normally have to pay extra for in most games. It is actually pretty easy to pick up - although that is probably because there are certain aspects that are similar to other games we have (like 7 wonders, or san juan). My family have all enjoyed it so far. I have some questions around replayability longer term as it feels to me like once you know how certain pairings work you are always going to seek those out, but there do seem to be a couple of expansions that may help address this.

1706,downstream,9.5,"Compelling gameplay with nice illustrations and lots of card combos. Certainly seems like some influence from San Juan in the tableau building aspect of the game (the Crane is very similar for example). This reminds me of San Juan or Seasons in the way the cards interact, but it feels a bit heavier than either of those, because there are some other things going on as well with the worker placement actions. It can be a bit thinky and perhaps prone to AP for slower or more deliberate players.  So far the only thing that bothers me a bit is the fact that, with so much going on, it can be easy to forget to activate some card or ability. Unfortunately, because some of the potential forgotten triggers may be bad for you, it can feel as though you've inadvertently cheated by forgetting something, so there are definitely times where we had to backtrack to maintain a fair game state. Hoping this is reduced with more plays! At this point I can't possibly imagine desiring the expansions because I wouldn't want to add any complexity. Maybe I would appreciate some new cards at some point.  At this point I've played with 2 and 3, but would probably not enjoy it at 4 because of increased game time and increased information you would need to track in the game.   * J learned this, loves it * C learned this, likes it (but hates the fool)  * sleeved (ultra pro matte) * upgraded insert added (mightiest meeple)",199792

With four players, you cycle through nearly the whole deck every play, and there is quite a lot of randomness concerning who gets what with the big game-deciding cards (Evertree, King and Queen, etc). Its thoroughly engaging but can be repetitive after many plays. On both the worker placement and engine building side, there are games with far more depth (Feast for Odin, Terraforming Mars etc) and clearly this game isn't trying to compete on that level - its trying to be streamlined and accessible.

1754,DroppEcho,8,"This is a lot like Imperial Settlers but with a common deck of cards and some worker placement sprinkled in between.  Maybe a little of Stone Age, too.  The basic mechanisms are quite simple.   Where the game shines is in the deck of cards and how well designed they are.  The combos are interesting and the game will give you plenty of chances to pivot your direction.   The main board is a bit too big on the table and the 3D tree is a nuisance (as is well documented).   Moves along quickly and I generally find myself constantly mulling over my cards plus the available cards in the Meadow and figuring out what I might be able to do.   The game certainly can end before you want it to, leaving you with a sense of not being able to achieve everything that you might have if you played just a little bit better.

1770,dtmoura,5,"Really does NOT live up to the hype... Art and components are outstanding but unnecessary and even unpractical. For example, the berries and wood components are quite round and roll all over and out of the board very easily (had to pick them up from floor multiple times). The whole tree is a gimmick.   Gameplay is quite mediocre, nothing innovative there: Collect resources, buy cards with them, get some powers, buy more cards. We've seen it a thousand times. But it is all quite ""diselegant"" as there are tons of cards with tons of small text. So you will spend quite a long time reading and thinking and reading them again, with everyone curved over the board trying to read the small letters... and then right when you have an basic route to take, someone buys the card you want it and the AP begins all over again.   There is also a brutal amount of escalation from round 1 to 4, which I usualy like, but it is just too much here. You can't do anything on round 1. After the 15min trying to read all cards, your actions will take 30 secs and round is over... But then round 4 will take forever.   Turns are very inefficient overall. Clearly the game was designed to feel ""tight"" but it just does not give you satisfaction when you realize you will need to spend all your works just to collect 3 resources and buy one card (which obviously someone else will buy before you do).   So gameplay is too light and blah for experienced players but the whole game is too cumbersome for a pleasant family experience.   Sold for a profit.",199792

We can send them on the map to gain resources (there are cards we can send our workers on, which are different in every game, so there is a lot of replayability ). And finnaly - we can buy a card from the central board. Cards are based on dependence: one card can be used to buy second one for free.

1804,dusk2dawn,8,"While the artwork may appear cute, it's important not to underestimate the potential for analysis paralysis induced by this game. In my frustration, I resorted to burning the tree that obstructed my view, finding it unnecessary. Unfortunately, one drawback of this game is its limited scalability for lower player counts. The engine-building aspect, centered around card drafting, necessitates a harmonization of cards. However, with an inflated deck, some cards may never have the opportunity to surface throughout the entire game. This reliance on chance rather than skill can be particularly problematic, especially with fewer players. The issue is further exacerbated when setting up special events that require specific cards for fulfillment, only to find that those prerequisite cards never appear. In such cases, the purpose of the special events becomes questionable. Consequently, I have decided against purchasing expansions that introduce even more cards to the already inflated deck, as I fear it will exacerbate the problem. I believe it would be akin to having too many cooks spoiling the broth.",199792

I'd rather have stable resources that won't roll off the table than pretty ones.  Also, the tree just gets in the way in a 4-player game.  We ended up dismantling it.  It's a pretty solid worker placement and tableau building game.  The fact that your tableau has limited space is a nice addition that requires you to play cards a bit more conservatively.  I like how the goals and special action spaces are randomized each game.  The most contentious part of the game is always going to be the shared card market.  In a 4-player game, a card you want is more likely to get grabbed by an opponent before you've had the chance to take your turn.  Having multiple copies of each card helps a bit, and I can see the risk being much lower in a 2-player game.  Also, this seems to be a much bigger issue with the character cards, which are much cheaper than the buildings.",199792

1859,Eeeville,8,"Everdell is primarily a tableau-based card game, but also includes a board, various resource types, and workers for the worker placement portion. Oh, and the tree. The massive tree. The board is an attractive place where all the worker placement areas are and includes place to put all of the game's resources as well as the tree. The tree holds workers, the deck of cards and a few other things. Much has been said about the tree: ""so thematic, it obscures the play area when playing with 4, it frays/becomes damaged from construction/deconstruction, and great for organization."" As for me, I side on the negative and do not use it. I also don't use the board to hold resources as I prefer to place them wherever it best fits an the table I'm playing. Anyway, this is all kind of preference. Let's talk about the game.  Players will find themselves taking turns to gather resources, points, drawing cards, discarding cards, and playing cards until they can no longer do so. Once this happens, they do a refresh turn. Different players will take different refresh turns at different points in the game based on the choices they've made. When a player can't do anything else after their 3rd refresh, their game is over. Other players keep playing until all players are complete. Then people will score and find out who wins.  One of the standout things to me, other than the tree, are that the base game has a hard hand limit of 8 cards and mostly a tableau of 15 cards. Most players will find these limits to be restrictive. As players get better at they game, they really have to optimize striking an balance between what's best to put in their tableau between the engine-building/resources and cards that will help you generate points. Too few resource generators and you may not even be able to fill your tableau and too many means you will likely not be in the running to win the game.  The other interesting aspect revolves around the two cards types: constructions (basically, buildings) and critters (aka people). When you build constructions, each type will want a specific kind of inhabitant (i.e. a Castle wants a king to inhabit it). In the game, this translates to players being able to use their buildings to play specific critters for free into their tableau beyond their other functions. This creates an interesting dynamic where you typically want to play constructions before critters to allow you to save resources when playing critters. This mingles interestingly when you consider the previously mentioned tableau limit. Sadly, finding the matching critters can be difficult between the flop of the massive card deck and your 8-card hand limit. There is some mitigation, though. On the board, there are 8 cards which any player can play. Additionally, when a player plays one of these cards, it's automatically refreshed. I don't feel like the game is determined by these random factors, but there is a degree of randomness that may frustrate gamers which prefer no-luck euros. Perhaps an advanced variant could be a draft of the initial 5-card hands after setup and the additional cards for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th players could be drawn randomly.  Other interesting factors are the addition of worker placement spots that change from game-to-game. The only negative thing I'd say about these is that they're stronger than the basic worker placement spots and the base ones don't see that much use (in the 2-3 player game anyway). It also has racing elements between the basic scoring events (the 1st to grab, usually 3, of a specific card type) and 4 random scoring special events from a pool of special events. These events require that you have two specifically named cards (typically one construction and critter). Workers are needed to grab these events. Lets hope you get to these first and have the worker to spare before your opponent does. These are other things that make you put a good deal of thought on what goes into your limited tableau.  It cannot be overstated how beautiful this game is and how wonderful the non-tree components are for the collector's edition of this game. I'm sure some will enjoy the tree, but it's not for me. Even the sturdier wooden tree that's sold separately. Well, I'm also not the biggest fan of the metal victory point tokens because the 1 & 3 tokens are the same colour. There is a size difference, but I would have preferred a different colours or maybe less shiny so the numbers were more legible. It should be noted that the first printing of the collector's edition had wood pieces that rolled everywhere, but this was corrected in the 2nd printing and can be purchased separately. I have no experience with the retail edition of the game and therefore, can't comment on them.   The game this most reminds me of is Seasons. Both are gorgeous tableau-based cards games that require token resources to play their cards. Both have similar card effect types: instant actions, end of game effects, and syncopated effects (per turn in Seasons, per refresh with a worker in Everdell. Additionally, both games have two card types (magic items and familiars in Seasons, and constructions and critters in Everdell). The main thing for me is the limited tableau size. In both games, it's desirable to acquire cards that self-sacrifice for a benefit or can get rid of other cards for a benefit. Seasons is the more aggressive game with includes negative interaction compared to Everdell's mostly euro-y ""you took the spot/card I wanted before I could."" While multiple players increase the game length substantially in both, it feels a bit less pronounced in Evedell due to the one action per player per turn. Also, the negative interaction makes Seasons a less enjoyable experience with more than 2. Everdell is probably more family friendly. I personally prefer Seasons, but I could easily see people preferring Evedell. I think both games can easily co-exist within a person's game collection.   My one and only real negative is that I feel the rules could be tighter. This is even considering I have the revised rules of the game. I still felt some of the card interactions and/or effects could have been better clarified. Thankfully, the designer is very active on the game's forum and will often answer any rule queries if another player hasn't already done so... and may even show up anyway to verify the answer.  Overall, if you like worker placement games and/or tableau based card games, you owe it to yourself to at least try Everdell. While it doesn't really do anything too innovative, it certainly has the right mixture for an extremely enjoyable and smooth gaming experience.   BTW...  Comments on the mini-expansion material included in the collector's edition (maybe elsewhere too) that aren't all listed in the BGG database:  Rugwart: This is a set of 3 cards that add a lot of negative interaction to the game. I haven't played with these, but most seem to say they don't like it and it doesn't feel like it fits within Everdell. It also includes a d8 and black rat meeples for a solo mode. I haven't tried it yet, so I can't really comment on that. This can be considered a new unique set of player pieces, which is nice because some people like rats and some people like playing with the colour black.  Extra! Extra! cards: These are just additional critters and constructions to add to the deck. On one hand, it's nice to have additional variety to add to the deck. On the other hand, you're diluting the deck which affects finding critter-construction pairs and trying to achieve special events. Additionally, they are not recommended to be added to the deck when using the Pearlbrook expansion due to it adding additional deck dilution. They aren't really an automatic add to the deck for me. If Pearlbrook delivers an enjoyable experience (haven't tried it yet), I can't ever see using these cards again.  Legendary cards: There are 5 critters and 5 constructions. Each player is randomly given one of each and is not considered to be in their normal hand of cards. These are powerful cards than can be played normally at a significant cost, or replace the specifically named card on each legendary, if it's in that player's tableau... for free. The legendary card counts (for the purpose of special events and perhaps other things) as a copy of the specially named/replaced card and can never be removed from your tableau. That said, the rules don't seem to specifically forbid you from having the specifically names card in your tableau and playing the legendary card by paying the resources. It seems against the spirit of the cards but doesn't seem to be expressly forbidden by the rules.   Each legendary card adds an extra space to your tableau. I like these cards, but am not sure I would use them every game. It makes the game longer since everyone has an extra two spaces in their tableau. Maybe this helps with going through more of the deck and being slightly more likely to find a specific card for card pairings and special event requirements. On the other hand, I don't think these are balanced properly against one another. This difference may not matter when you consider that the normal random card flops can probably benefit some players more than others. Overall, something decent to try every now and again.",199792

1869,eimative,8,"I'm a huge fan of games employing cards with unique game effects, as it greatly improves replay value for me. These cards are the heart of the game, everything else is a basic worker placement - get goods - convert to points thing. The urge to match these cards to their counterparts (half the deck is characters linked to houses in the other half), may be overwhelming to first time players, still it does add an excitement and urgency to collecting them.  A unique mechanic found in the game is the unscripted end of an age. Each player ""chooses"" when their age ends and their workers reset (I say choose, because it really just happens when you run out of actions). Still the non structure to this was refreshing.  The silly 3D tree is strictly game chrome, which I can take or leave. The element that jilted the game from being a rank 7, was the lack of purposeful locations on the board near the end. I was super bummed that I played a very efficient game (filled my 15 card tableau) and had nothing to do foe the whole 1/3 end of the game. I no longer needed cards/resources which is pretty much most of the action selections, so I was just stuck. I felt penalized for doing a good job.",199792

That is the reason why everyone should try to play this at least once. The game is not bad, though it's not brilliant either.  Even if there is some engine building involved, the game doesn't give a chance to really run that engine. I felt a bit disappointed about that. Green cards produce in spring and again in autumn, but in spring players have very few cards so the real production comes as late as in autumn.   Resources are quite tight. Though some cards enable building some new cards for free, which makes building sometimes very efficient. Unfortunately, that makes game quite luck-dependent too as it's possible that all those suitable cards are always grabbed before your turn and replacement cards are just crap. And maybe you would always draw that crap from the deck too.  As players have limited building space and as they can enter different seasons separately regardless of where other players are on their time of year, it's possible that some player can finish their game before other players. That's not very good thing, especially if that happens much earlier than other players are finishing their game - then it would be as annoying as player elimination.",199792

Mechanically challenging (though not with a particularly complex ruleset) and satisfying, conflict-free, a very strong and beautiful theme… Basically, a solitary engine-builder/ civilization game of the highest order (at least in the lower mid-tier in this genre). A lot to love in my view.  So why not a ten? There can be quite a bit of downtime as players must study plenty of cards with small text, synergies, worker placement in the right order, resource and card management. The more thought and time you are willing to invest (and slow down play for others), the higher you will score. Which is fair. But not everyone at the table might be equally invested. Also, because you progress through seasons at different speeds, some may finish considerably earlier. This is basically player elimination by ""choice"" (or rather, you ran out of resources). This is puzzle only for very like-minded people/ the same player types. It does what it aims to do, perhaps not perfectly, but exceptionally well. ",199792

1969,enzo622,9.5,"What a surprise this one was. I admit that seeing the silly tree had me subconsciously assign the game to some lesser category of sophistication when it’s really a game with a lot of vitality (even just the base game itself) inhabiting an original world of its own that keeps growing via expansions. I’m all in on the four expansions (though I’ve yet to try them all).   This is a worker placement, tableau builder where you have a 15-card tableau limit in which you’re trying to find and build the best combos. The first half of that effort is, admittedly, the weak point of the game, but so far, it’s not been crippling. That is, once you start putting some cards out, there are some associated ones you very much want. First, because in a mechanism akin to 7 Wonders, certain cards allow subsequent cards to be built for free (e.g., the Monastery allows a free build of the Monk). Second, because there will be random goals in play each game whereby the first player to build 3 specific characters/buildings gets points.   Most of the game you get cards from blind draws off the deck. The happenstance is mitigated by a market whereby you can purchase a card from it in lieu of drawing from the deck for free. Of course, if the one you want is available long before your turn, you very well may not even have a chance to get it. Fortunately, there are multiple copies of each card. In fact, the deck of 100+ cards looks imposing at first but it’s really not due to duplicate copies. I found myself familiar with the cards halfway through my first game.   That out of the way, the game offers an impressive amount of variability. Hell, just the base game itself has a bunch of modular aspects to it such as variable action spots each game such that one resource may be abundant or scarce depending on which action tiles are in play. You can’t always count on the same ones.   Now, the most salient feature of the design is that you may finish a season before the other players and be out of phase with them. This means you may finish spring, do any production, and immediately start placing your workers again in the summer phase while other players are still placing workers (on the same board) in the spring phase. I like being out of sync with my opponents as much as I can, so I enjoy the considerations. When someone passes to the next season, all those action spots open up again, so maybe you try to delay for that or, conversely, maybe you want to pass (as you get an additional worker each time you pass) and start placing again while your opponents finally pass and open the board up.   A quick word on the expansions; the world is very cute and all the expansions are thematic in their own way relative to their world (for ex, you use a new frog worker to dive to the depths of the pond in Pearlbrook).   Lastly, some graphic design gripes. As someone in his 50s with ever weakening eyesight, I'm disappointed at the graphic design choice of this game to have very, very tiny fonts. For heaven's sake, people, the art is secondary to the information. Give your players a break! And while the tree is a cute idea, it's 100% not feasible in a 4P game (we laid it flat on the table).  UPDATE: This has become one of my all-time favorite games. I sold this version to buy the Complete Collection. I ding it half a point because sometimes -- at least with just the base game -- one player lucks into an early set of cards that propels them to a walk-in-the-park victory. Not always, but we've had some games that were battles for second place early on.",199792

1985,ErikViking,7,"The game is highly regarded for a reason... but it feels so slow at the beginning of each game.  My main criticism is that all the cards and options are on show from the very beginning and show how they interact and the fun you can have making interesting decisions. Then you look at your resources and notice you can't do anything for the next 5 turns except collecting resources and playing a card or two. The slow build-up does pay off heavily with a wildly interesting game with tight resources. But why can't it start that way? Why do I have to play for half an hour to an hour before the fun part? couldn't the game start ahead and keep the tight resource and strategic play?  Also with 4 slow players this game becomes REALLY slow, so much so that I would rather play something else.  Compared to other games in the genre it also just doesn't click for me thinking ahead here is hard and skill is mostly based on who can manage the most information.  Though I am always reluctant to play I do enjoy the game. I don't think it does enough for me to ever have me craving for another game.  If I am in the mood for a game like Everdell I'll rather play Beyond the Sun where every turn feels good and I enjoy the entire experience even the build up.",199792

At first I had no idea why I would ever use the dungeon. Or the ruin. Or the university. Then it clicked.  The base mechanics are very simple, turns are short with very little wait between. It's quick to explain, easy to learn, but harder to actually play well. I taught the game to my SO after figuring it out (and playing the digital version a bunch of times): His first play scored 30 VP. Next play 35 VP. Third play 49 VP. This ramp up is telling of the type of learning curve you're looking at when picking this up - it may take a few goes to really get it. Unless you're my brother that is, who wiped us first try with 65 VP.  It's an amazing game. Well worth a try. Or probably 3.  There are a few caveats, however. Beginner's mistakes can be very punishing. During one of our plays, one new player almost immediately progressed as the resources he wanted were unavailable. Nobody else did, meaning none of his resources unlocked. So he progressed early. Again. He was in autumn while nobody else had progressed at all, and his resource spots remained locked. Of course.  In the end, he had to sit out while the remaining players finished their two seasons, losing hard, scoring under 30vp. Not great.  It's worth discussing some baseline tactics with your new players to prevent things like this. That it's sometimes worth sacrificing the expensive cards you cannot play in order to gain resources to get a basic engine going.",199792

2023,evanrchristo,8.5,"After unpacking and playing twice at two player, here are my initial thoughts:   PROS:  - As stated by most everyone: this game is BEAUTIFUL! The board game makes a larger table space needed, but that is expected for a tableau builder. The complexity of the Evertree and Gameboard actually helps to save space and creates the game board (AKA the game and gameplay itself) as a centerpiece for play.  - Great variability in options between the Forest Actions and Special Events. - All components of the game are great quality. I was worried about the Evertree, but it is solid. I may use a sealant on the edge of cardboard to keep the ends from fraying. The meeples are fantastic, and the resources are quite realistic.  - The rule book is very simple and streamlined. We learned to play straight from the rules in about 10 minutes. We only had to reference the text once during the game to solve one issue (See ""closing thoughts"" below).  - Gameplay is very smooth, and decisions are very meaningful. While there are so many actions to take, the order and timing of taking the actions is important. There is both strategy (Starting Cards, Special Events), and tactics (Limited Action Spaces, Variable Cards, Interesting Combos).  - Gameplay (at least at two players) is VERY quick. Granted, my wife and I are both quick players with very little analysis paralysis, but our first game (after reading the rules) took 28 minutes to play (and another 2 minutes to score--had to check rule book on that process) for a total game of 30 minutes. Our second game was a bit longer because we both tried new strategies and tried to make bigger combos, but still played in 40 minutes.   CONS:  - The resources, while beautiful, need extra storage on the table. The Twigs and small cylinders and prone to roll. The berries, as the creator promised, don't actually roll all that much. However, all the resources take up a considerable amount of space one the board. If this is a problem for you, it is easily address through small containers. Keeping them in the bags is an option. We used the clear Stonemaier resource containers for one game.  - At times, getting resources can be very challenging at times. You can use workers to fetch some, but you can also build and engine with cards. However, the cards are random, so luck is an element.  - This game (literally every aspect of it) is SO prone to a bad table nudge. While the tree feels very sturdy, I would not want to test it, either. At one point our cat jumped on the table, and I about had a heart attack. Now, I am not sure what could be done different, and I don't think a change is needed (aside from resources). It is just something players should keep in mind.  - Set-up and tear-down is a little bit lengthy for the length of gameplay. There are three decks to shuffle and pass out (two are very small and quick, but still steps to take). Building the Evertree takes some care, too. It also may be that I am obsessive in my organization and want to do the board justice and keep everything neat and tidy and pretty.   CLOSING THOUGHTS: - The PROs definitely outweigh the CONs. I rate this game a 9.0 because it is one I ""very much enjoy playing"" and ""would suggest it to others"". The game is so easy to pick up, and, to me at least, the actions make sense. The one part that was not totally clear was the ""Prepare for Season"" action, which is when you pull workers back. This only occurs four times throughout the game when you have finished all available actions (placing workers and playing cards) and there are some significant other things that happen then, too. For some reason, my wife and I assumed this was like Agicola, and everyone pulled workers at the same time, then the Stuff happens. However, this action occurs when a player individually takes that action, so players can be at different phases of the game (with slightly different rules). It makes sense when you read the rule book, we just didn't expect it. Perhaps a ""Designer's Note"" saying this could be helpful to some.  - I am so thankful to be a backer and supporter of this game. It is beautiful on the table, and I think it will be a great tool in helping people get into the hobby. The gameplay is simple and (it seems) the gameplay can be deep, too. The quality of the game shows the care the creator and publisher places into this product. It fills a great spot in my personal collection of light worker placement and tableau building (which is unique for me). I will continue to play this as often as possible and share it with friends and family. Great work, James A. Wilson, Andrew Bosley, and Starling Games! Thank you for Everdell!",199792

2025,EvanW5,8.44,"Everdell is a unique combination of ""worker-placement"" and ""city-builder"" games. Players use their workers to travel around the board collect resources and exchange those to create a village full of cool buildings and critters. With so much card variability, players can try out different synergies and combos every game. Everdell has a high amount of complexity and therefore has a high skill ceiling.

Initially I was skeptical due to to both the low number of resources and the low number of starting meeple but very quickly found that there was a lot more that you could do each turn than you expected to be able to do. I like that cards are also a resource and must also be carefully managed and or pitched to gather other resources.  I like that each of the 'unique' buildings and characters are not infact unique and so if someone has played one of them you can still hunt in the deck for the other copy should you so choose, as opposed to race for the galaxies unique 6 point developments which could easily be hate drafted to stop someones big score at end game. I am also not sure what I think about the fool card, which seems a little out of place and jarring as a decidedly take that card  I enjoyed that you must also consider or manage when you pass each season too. This is unique (I think) to this game, and it the only way workers come back to you. There is depth in the tableau building aspect, and there are satisfying interactions from inherently synergistic cards but honestly would have liked a few more cards in this as we played through the deck at least twice.   The large tree standee is a bit much honestly and whilst it looks pretty and does add to the overall aesthetic, it does make it difficult to actually see other players boards and the cards placed within its branches.",199792

Comentários: Ouvi falar muita coisa desse jogo e por conta disso criei uma expectativa muito alta sobre ele, principalmente por ter como mecânica principal ""alocação de trabalhadores"" que é a minha mecânica favorita. Mas infelizmente as minhas expectativas ficaram longe de serem atendidas. Porém, já adianto, o jogo não é ruim, apenas não achei tudo isso que já ouvi falar. No jogo somos criaturas encantadas da floresta de Everdell, onde temos como missão montar a melhor vila. Para isso devemos contratar novas criaturas e construir novos edifícios. Na sua vez de jogar você tem três opções: alocar um trabalhador; jogar uma carta (construir); ou passar de estação. Normalmente alocar um trabalhador significa pegar recursos, onde esses recursos servem para você jogar cartas. Jogar carta nada mais é que construir ela na sua vila, e pra isso, você deve ter os recursos necessários contidos na carta, ou ter um edifício construído que deixe você jogar uma criatura de graça. Já a última opção, passar uma estação, significa que você irá recolher todos os seus trabalhadores e receber novos para uma nova estação. O jogo termina quando todos os jogadores terminam de realizar as suas ações na última estação. Ganha o jogador que possuir mais pontos em sua vila contando os pontos nas cartas e outros conquistados. O jogo não é muito complexo, até que dá para jogar com jogadores que não sejam tão iniciantes assim. Acredito que a dificuldade maior será em montar estratégias, mas isso até jogadores mais experientes vão ter, pois é um jogo que você precisa ler e conhecer o que cada carta faz. De ponto negativo eu diria que é a quantidade de texto que cada jogador deve ler para conhecer as cartas, e como você as vezes pode ativar cartas de oponentes seus, então você tem que ficar consultando o que cada um construiu na sua vila e isso pode deixar o jogo cansativo. Com mais partidas, esse ponto negativo vai desaparecendo, pois aos poucos os jogadores vão se familiarizando com as cartas. Mas o ponto que mais me incomodou é a sorte na estratégia. Por se tratar de um jogo onde você deve tentar montar uma vila onde as cartas tem uma sinergia entre elas para você pontuar bem, muitas vezes você fica a mercê que venha a carta que você está precisando. Então pode ocorrer de um jogador ter a sorte de pegar só carta que ele quer pra sua vila e outro só pegar carta que não case com a sua estratégia. Jogar cartas de graça nesse jogo é muito benéfico, mas você só faz isso se você construir um edifício e depois ter a sorte de pegar a criatura respectiva daquele edifício, e pode ocorrer dela nunca vir ou sair na mão de outro jogador. Já de ponto positivo, sem sombras de dúvida fica por conta da arte. Que jogo lindo! Vira uma linda paisagem na mesa com uma árvore em 3D (que infelizmente mais atrapalha do que ajuda, mas é linda!). O material usado na produção do jogo é excelente, muito bom mesmo. Enfim, é um bom jogo, mas longe de ser algo que me fez querer ficar jogando ele direto.   Modo Solo:",199792

2066,familywontplay,7.3,"Collector's edition especially, visually enjoyable with high quality components &  includes Legendary Expansion..  Different play everytime.  Icons in the corner could be bigger.  Play is similar to the chaining effect of 7 Wonders where purchasing of a  unique card allows for the free development of another card.  Rules not complicated.   What I found most interesting about this game, there are 3 seasons.  In other games this would constitute three rounds where all players finish at the sametime before advancing to the next round.  Here players do take turns, 1 action to a turn, but players keeps playing through all 3 seasons, not waiting for the other players--essentially a 1 round game.  This means the player finishing first is out of the game.  The last player might finish a long time after this first player.    How is this possible?  This is due mainly to chaining cards as mentioned above.  If a player buys every card with resources, they are not going to have many turns.  Those who chain, lay down a second card for free and thus getting extra actions.  In other words, one person might spend 1 or more precious meeples to acquire a card which gives end game points, whereas a player who chains can lay down double the cards for the same amount of meeples & resources, doubling their actions in the game.  However, the meeples of the player who is out of the game, still stay on the board, blocking locations other players need.  This increases the need for planned & strategic play for those lagging behind.  Purchase of the right cards throughout the game can help avoid this dilemma.  Some of the print on the cards is excruciatingly tiny & easily overlooked.  We had to keep pointing it out to each other.",199792

My kids absolutely fell in love with the resource components, to say nothing of the rest of the pretty cardboard and cards, from the moment they laid eyes on them. The game itself is good, but doesn't impress me as much.  It leaves me with a curious feeling of being somewhat constrained.  I would submit that there is also an above-average amount of luck for a tableau-building game of this weight.  Once certain buildings are built, a corresponding creature card that is normally very expensive and worth lots of points will become free to place - if you can find it.  The game tries to mitigate the luck, but isn't entirely successful in my view. On the bright side, there are interesting decisions to be made, it really does only take 60-90 minutes with 4, and it will be relatively easy to get people that are normally adverse to non-light games to try.",199792

First plays it's a bit overwhelming because of the linked constructions and critters which it makes it difficult to parse the board state. The theme is very nice and definitely succeeds at creating redwall vibes. Would enjoy it even more if there were some evil horde to fight off instead of just building a city. The first turns go quickly and the last turns lasat a while as you start to combo off. It is necessary to build a mix of early game cards to start building your engine but you don't want to many as your city fills up quickly. This aspect makes for some intersting decisions. ,199792

Then he sat there for the next 45 minutes watching two of the three remaining players draw the game waayyyyy out.  I won but is probably the worst I've felt after a win.  Drawing the game out definitely seemed like the ""correct"" strategy for where I was.  At least one of the other players did the same thing or I would have felt even worse.   Guy who finished first had to sit there and watch the rest of us catch up and pass him while he did nothing.  Lesson learned I suppose but was not a good first gaming experience for anyone really.

The first playthrough was underwhelming, struggling to get momentum in the first season, not managing to utilise the chain mechanic between buildings and critters, and the special events were not even considered on the first playthrough.  However, each play since the gameplay has felt better understood, seasons can be prolonged. Most significantly, this has been our favourite couple game every lockdown weekend. The reason is, this is such a calm and aesthetically pleasing game, with the evidently pleasing tree structure and the endearing meeples.

2134,fisha,7.5,"Szuper grafika és nagyon csábító kivitelezés, ami azonban azért a praktikussági szempontokat nem annyira veszi figyelembe. De nem biztos, hogy akkora baj ez, mert aki unja már a fával való vacakolást, az megteheti, hogy nem szereli össze, csak akkor ha valakiket nagyon le akar nyűgözni a játékkal. Maga a játékmenet leginkább kombózós tablóépítés. hasonlóan a birodalmi telepesekhez és az évszakokhoz. A kártyák grafikája miatt szokták talán inkább az évszakokhoz hasonlítani, bár mechanikában inkább kicsit közelebb áll a telepesekhez.  Alapvetően kombókersést indukál mechanika, megtalálni azt az utat, amivel a lehető legtöbb lapot tudom játékba hozni az adott fordulóban. Itt is olyan érzésed van, hogy jó ha 2 lapot le tudsz tenni aztán csak kikerekedik mindig valami út, és kiszalad 4-5-10 lap is. Ez adja a fő örömfaktort. Ha ezek még hosszútávon is hasznosnak tűnnek az extra boldogság. Így 80%-ban taktikai keresgélésnek mondanám a játékot, előre elhatározni nem sok mindent lehet, ahhoz túl nagy a random a lapok feljövése miatt.  Érdekes ötlet, hogy van saját és közös lapkészlet is. Alapból nyilván jobban megéri a közösből építeni, de abban van rizikó, hogy elviszik-e előled. Szóval ez is egy döntés.  Fontos még megemlíteni, hogy elsőre azért elég nehezen játszható a rengeteg, ráadásul apró betűs szöveg miatt. De nagyon gyorsan tanulható a kártyák lényege, így harmadik játékra, már pörög minden. Kettesben szerintem 45 perc alatt is pörgethető, és jól összeáll. Négyesben vannak kicsit kétségeim, mert ha 2-3 órára húzódik, akkor azért felmerül, hogy annyi azért nincs benne.",199792

I found the level of meaningful interaction low, because it is virtually impossible to look across the table and get a sense of what the other players might be trying to accomplish (due in part to the small font size, and also from the large quantity of cards in play). I very much liked the mechanic where players aren't necessarily in the same phase of the game, so there is strategy in deciding when to enter the next season to perhaps block players from using certain worker spaces or making them available to yourself.

Because of the simple, tactical, and transparent mechanics that are highly focused on resource gathering/exchange/spending, there is not enough mystery or thrill in the game.  Additionally, the game is a bit short and not flexible enough for me... to really feel like I'm building something captivatingly connective/narrative.  The buildings and actions don't carry as much weight as they could.

In theory, it's got a great set of mechanics: a bit of worker placement to fuel the card-driven tableau-based engine building. In practice, though, I have not gotten huge amounts of pleasure playing the game. I feel that the turn-by turn play as well as the final score are affected a bit too much by the luck of the card draw and super-tight resource collection process. I think that some of the expansions might help address these issues, but I'm not sure I want to spend more money to double down on this one.

2199,Fragasnap,2,"A simple resource-conversion card-based engine-builder, very text-heavy, very heads-down.  Your ability to perform is wildly throttled by card-search space, especially emphasized by constructions which each grant a stipend of 4 to 6 Berries (a fairly expensive resource) with which to build a specific Critter card.  The intrinsic combos implied by these production chains and further special VP Events that are earned by building specific cards make the entire game feel more on-rails than most games of the sort.  Being that card-search is so important, the moving supply of cards available to all players makes winning on the flop incredibly common.  Worker placement feels pidgin, with forest spaces and meadow spaces providing so many replacements that the interaction never feels meaningful.  Variant: Fool is worth 1VP, takes no space, and grants a -5VP penalty (-4VP total) if your town has no empty spaces.",199792

2209,FranzK,7,"* I think this is one of the best if not the best mid-weight worker placement games out there. Rajas of the Ganges is probably my other favorite but I think this has surpassed it.  This game does a lot of things well, taking fairly standard mechanics and adding just enough wrinkles and theme to make it really stand out. There are two wrinkles that differentiate the game: 1. Constructions in your tableau allow you to build corresponding critters for free; and 2. The fact that different players enter a new round (prepare for a season) at different times is something I haven't seen in other games. This game also has beautiful art, excellent components and design, and a fair amount of variability in the goals, resource spaces and cards. Setup and teardown is actually fairly quick (especially if you just leave the tree out).  I have two criticisms of the game that are seeming more and more minor they more I play:  1. The randomness of the card draw is more swingy than most of its peers. This is mainly because it can be a huge advantage to draw a critter that corresponds to a building in your tableau. Fortunately, there are enough paths to victory and enough ways to cycle through the deck to mitigate this somewhat. Also, after playing it more, I've found that there's always something worthwhile to do - but if someone happens to draw, say, a queen when they have the palace in their tableau, that is some nice luck.  2. The special events are usually not attainable for the reason stated in #1. A player needs to have very specific cards in their tableau to complete them so there's a lot of luck involved. As I play more, though, I don't mind. It's fun to try to go for them while being aware that they are pretty rare. And it feels great when you can get one or two.  Really a great game overall and I enjoy at all player counts. Plus I love those sproingy berries!  I'm really glad I gave this game another chance after my initial handful of plays - I didn't care for it at first and I was wrong.",199792

Players are racing for the basic events, special event cards, and journey spots in Autumn.

2227,FriendFive,7.5,"I have way more plays than actually logged because I wasn't consistent with logging.  This is a charming game that I can actually get my family to play with me. The theme and artwork are really special and the mechanics are pretty straightforward.   The bits are visually and tactilely pleasing, though they can be difficult to pick up, especially the smooth, flat stones. The rubbery berries are also too bouncy and are hard to keep in place on the board. The tree is there mostly for visual ""chrome"" but it somewhat functional because it keeps the large draw deck organized and stacked nicely. However, the tree seems like, even when you are careful, it will take continued wear and tear as you assemble it and reassembly it. Maybe the production cost could have been shifted from the bits to making the tree plastic or acrylic. To be honest, you could easily play without the tree and just organize the components that it holds off to the side of the board.  The first time or two playing it can feel like there isn't much to do in the first ""season"" of the game and  it's hard to imagine building your ""city"" with 15 cards. But once you understand the ""engine"" that makes this game go, it opens up the possibilities and helps you see how you can do more than you thought you could with so little. So in this game the early turns go by very quickly and then when you've built the engine properly (via the synergies of the cards you play) the end game turns take much longer.  This is a good worker placement game where you feel the real tension of competition with other players for the prime spots that you need your workers in to get the resources you need.  The rulebook is beautiful and full of the same charm and theme that the game has, though the authors could have spent less effort on the whimsical tone and made some of the rules much more clear. I'm thinking of the snarky text about the mechanic of the Chip Sweep card, for example. ""Copying"" locations could have been more explicitly explained, and the way the Miner Mole mechanic sort of muddies up that concept could have been better explained.",199792

No forward planning beyond a couple of actions. But without the speed of a card game like crib.     There are good combinations to look out for but the deck is so big, you can't forward plan because they may never appear, even if you are dealt one card of an excellent two-card combo. You are just lucky if they appear for you; Then you win. Otherwise it is a tedious exercise of hoping something interesting will happen.

The first is that card draws may lead to a pretty swingy game, though more games are needed to verify. It reminds me of Terraforming Mars in that respect, though it is less irritating here due to the significantly shorter gameplay. More games need to use the Underwater Cities approach of differing card tiers as the game progresses to mitigate this type of thing. Card tiers also increases the probability of drawing a card you want, resulting in much less card-mining the draw deck and more focus on the interesting parts of the game. The second issue I have is that the initial play took way too long at 4p for a game of this style, though I'd expect this to disappear as players grow more familiar with the game.

2247,Frydaze1,8.5,"We played our first time, and it took about 2 hours.   We decided up front to play our cards face up, and discuss sometimes, and redo moves we'd screwed up or get resources we'd forgotten to get. We might play more cutthroat once we're comfortable, but we prefer to play a learning game the first time, and point out helpful things to each other as we go.  Husband got some lucky card combinations right off the bat, while I never really did. So he kept getting bonus actions and bonus resources. I was out of guys in Summer before he'd even finished Spring. But we both filled up our city too early, so Autumn wasn't much fun. We learned our lesson with that.  Surprisingly, I won the first game by one point. We were both convinced he'd trounced me from the get go. Various reviewers said that while it's good with two, it's better with three or four. But I think that might be difficult, with the directionality of the board and the big tree in the way. Perhaps the tree could be set to the side, so the players could all gather around the primary board. And I suspect that each additional player would add an hour of time to play.  It will take some time to learn what the really helpful cards are, and how to best combine them, and what to put into your city, and when to dump cards for resources. But I think this is one we're going to play a lot. And I think once we start to get a little bored with it, the expansions look like they add enough to make it all fresh again.",199792

2321,GarfieldKlon,2,"What did I miss? The tree is totally useless and doesn't make it better regarding the theme. There is not much theme in this game. There is so much luck, especially the starting hand. We were 3 players, 2 of us had bad luck with the starting hand (no combos), the other player had luck and could make many combos and played much longer in the first phase than the other 2 did. So it was already clear who will win even before we entered spring phase...  The main thing is about to get cards which will get you ressources and matching buildings with creatures. If you can't get those you're out. No chance against other who can build such combos. And building those is pure luck.  The cards look nice, but that doesn't make a good game.

All players are building their own towns, and some just end up more prosperous, due to luck or strategy, every town feels very comfortable and lively. If you're the kind of person who loves world-building but doesn't often have the time to devote hours to do it, this game is perfect for you.

2355,GemTimeGames,5,"Mixed feelings on this game. It clearly had a lot of thought put into it, so I must give it credit for that. The art and pieces are high quality, although personally that means relatively little to me. However, there's not really anything novel about the design. It's exactly what you would think of if someone told you it was a worker placement, engine building, city-builder. There isn't really anything that stands out. The ability for players to end the game at different times, is probably the closest thing to a unique element.  Some people have made comments about the lack of player interaction, and I actually view this as a good thing. Games with too much interaction allow players to gang up on the winning player, effectively making it worthless to play a good game and pull out in front, at least until the very end. This game does not allow that, and that is a good thing.   In my opinion this game doesn't have a lot of strategy. Most of your decisions are reactionary/tactical based on the cards you were dealt, the cards you draw, and what is in the meadow. There is a LOT of luck within this part of the game, and for a game with this much luck, it lasts way too long (2hrs+ unless you aren't thinking about your options at all). The replayability looks to be mediocre, since the multiple copies of buildings and critters mean that a lot of the same combos are going to be built each game.",199792

2377,GeorgW,7.5,"I was worried that it would be more form than function, like Wingspan, but it's not.   [b]Pros:[/b] It's absolutely beautiful. I love the plentitude of options for different animal meeples and the art is great. The deluxe resources, especially the berries are great. The tree can get in the way, but it's entirely optional.   The tight worker placement combined with tableau building really works and limits options and enforces timing concerns in a satisfying way.   The thing that elevates this game is the card effects, they're all interesting and detailed. Sure there's some big windfalls or whiffs possible, but that's all part of the excitement.  The 8-card meadow is a nice solution for finding card combos in such a big deck, and the variability of special events and forest locations is truly meaningful.* The 15 card limit of your tableau and the 8 card hand limit feels constricting in all the right ways.  I really love the seasons mechanism as an innovation of asynchronous rounds. It was lifted in Tapestry, without realizing what makes it so very good here: It's a very well-hidden and well-balanced catch-up mechanism. If you have fewer actions in a round, often a sign that you're behind, you will often have first dibs on the best worker placement locations and can also put pressure on other players to pass earlier than they want to not let you run the board.   [b]Cons:[/b] There are some issues. One is luck of the draw, especially combined with special events and free critter combos. The meadow alleviates it, to the point that it's not really an issue with larger player counts, but with 2 players it's quite impactful.   I think that the Fool is a problem, not because it costs 2 points, but because it takes up a space. It's way too punishing for its cost and just feels out of place in this otherwise bucolic game.  I like the variability of the forest spaces, but they can cause boring game states if they don't combo well, so I would have liked some recommended sets. Yet another case of variability for the sake of variability hurting each individual play.  The special events are way too specific, it's very swingy whether you can end up getting them.   Finally, the game is AP-inducing. There's a lot of different cards with text on them and a lot of important, small choices such as picking which ""any""-resource you want or which cards to discard. One of the game's strengths is its speed, and it usually plays fast, but with AP-prone players I'd rather play something else.",199792

2380,Germflinger,3,"My rating for this game is based on one play, it may increase if I play it again. Though it is a beautiful game, Everdell is in the slipstream with a mass of other new games and I don't see it having many more plays. The game is gorgeous and the production quality is really really good, my hat goes off to the artist who was involved in this project. Unfortunately, The gameplay immediately did not click for me, I have played quite a number of worker placement games and this one was a slug from the beginning. I think there is a real issue with being able to read the cards, there is a lot of important tiny text that is difficult to read. Where the tree is impressive visually it actually works against trying to read the cards in play (and is very inefficient). I feel that the way the seasons work makes the game a bit unbalanced, allowing the workers to sit in and block key spots for way too long. The randomness of the cards can have a huge impact on gameplay, if you draw a bad hand in startup you may have a hard time being competitive (if you draw awesome you can have a huge advantage). If a player finishes at the end of the last season early it can be a long wait before the game actually ends, this subtracts from the fun for me. All in all a beautiful game that does not deliver the amount of enjoyment one would expect (this is not unusual in the current game market in my opinion).",199792

Also: this should lose a point for not including the black rat meeples in the retail version as anyone who buys the pearlbrook expansion will get a useless black frog meeple.

I think the Unrigged solo variant is better than the standard solo mode, and that's probably how I will play going forward. Kind of reminds me of Wingspan in the sense that you have a pretty simple and limited set of actions you can take at any given time, but the culmination of those actions and your decision making leads to a fair amount of depth. Although, admittedly, I think Wingpsan does it better. Even as a solo game though, this is quite a table hog. And it's a bit bloated mechanically as well.

2398,gildedrain,4,"[ SEE MY UPDATE! ] I don't understand why they designed it so that players can proceed on different timelines.  One player can remove themself from the game early and this sets the bar for how many points the other players have to beat in order to win.  They get to watch for potentially quite awhile as other people play, with them having nothing to do except watch and wait.  If this isn't bad enough, a game about forest critters where they don't scurry around doing a ton of stuff in each season.  In Spring and Summer they do 2 and 3 things.  That's.... not scurrying.  That's not busy.  We expected each season to be substantial.  Instead Spring is over in 5 minutes, Summer in 10, Autumn in 30?, and Winter can really drag on as the game increases in complexity as each player builds their village and gains more of an engine / options to consider.  Aesthetics: perfect.  Game Design: all three of us hated it.  We kept checking the rules to see if we were missing something.  The rulebook isn't great either.  But no, this one is not for us.  UPDATE: We played this a second time a year later, on Tabletopia.  I was convinced I must have played it wrong.  We didn't.  We just ALL got TERRIBLE hands of cards that really ruined our first impression of the game, crippling us entirely and spoiling the game.  In this second play we all got fantastic combos in our first hand of cards, and we were able to build upon that at a steady and methodical pace through the seasons, chaining combo after combo after combo together.  After 2 hours we were all convinced it's a game we should own and keep in our regular game night rotation.  What a swing, from a D to an A in one play.  Geez.  So glad we gave it a second chance!  [UPDATE AGAIN] Oh man... this game is swingy.  We've played it twice more and in both of those games 1-2 players got really unlucky card draws, and 1-2 players got incredibly lucky card draws.  How one player's experience with a game can swing so drastically from one play session to another through no mistake of their own seems really off-putting to me.  In our last two plays, 1-2 players finished early and had to wait 20 minutes or so for the game to wrap up.  I spent the entirety of the last two games frustrated that I couldn't get an engine going, my resources were always sparse, and being able to see across the table at ""The Joneses"" living it up just made me feel like I was destined for a bad time and they were blessed by the Evertree.  In the end, the scores were all within a few points of each other, which almost makes it worse?  All of their apparent success (and FUN during the game!) didn't actually translate into points, where my lack of fun somehow worked out almost as well?  With a great hand of cards, this game sings.  With a mediocre hand, few resources, no combos, few workers, ...it's a real slog.  I'm going back to a negative opinion of this one.  People keep saying ""You don't like it because it's not the game you want it to be.""  Maybe?  I want it to be fun every time I play it.  I have plenty of games where it's fun to play and lose, but this one can somehow manage to be unpleasant to win.  I really wanted this game to be great, but the randomness of card draws is just too much. I've thought about house rules like Mulligans or draw over 8 and discard down, but that's something that should have been sorted out in play-testing.  I'd rather go play something else than fix this to my liking.  Blah... I'm so annoyed that I don't like this game!  I should probably mention that the 4 of us in our game group do not agree on this.  We had a 45 minute discussion that carried over into the following day.  The guy who got a good hand of cards in each of the 3 games he's played is the one in love with the game.  I suggested he try playing my hand and see how it feels. :P  Also, there are a lot of comments suggesting that ""once you learn the deck and what the combos are, the game opens up, you know what to look for, the chains are more obvious, it's less random, etc etc.""  Maybe I really dislike card games... I don't want to learn your deck.  I want to play a strategy game where my skill and wits are the deciding factor, not the card draw.  I can't shake the feeling that if this game did not have worker placement, I wouldn't confuse it with a strategy game and I'd approach it like a card game.... but I already know I don't prefer card games... so that probably wouldn't help either.",199792
2399,gildorn,10,"Traded Blood Rage for Everdell -- Everdell is played over three rounds. In the first round, you are trying to get get any cards into your city (tableau), which can be difficult because you start with no resources and only two workers. As the rounds progress, so do your options as you build your strategy, all the while pivoting on what cards present themselves. The heart of this resource management, card drafting tableau builder is card combos. Everdell excels at card combos. We are still figuring out how to optimize certain cards. My wife and I play 2p all the time and it can be like a chess match, my moves play off hers and the timing to switch seasons plays into it's own strategic tempo. Great card art and overall table presence. Feels like a light game, but has the decision space of a much heavier, medium weight game.",199792

It's so popular & eye-catching on the table at a public gamenight & i've warmed up to this type of worker placement enough that i figured it's worth another try. The ""song"" lyrics on page one of the rulebook are a red flag tho... clearly written by a committee, which makes me suspect that the whole game was a contrived thematic niche-filler from the start! Cute artwork. Decent enough play i suppose, but nothing particularly innovative. Like Agricola, it starts out pretty painfully constricted & feels like you'll never get enough done, so you spend the game desperately hunting for workable combos... & sure enough, when the game ends you're left with many loose ends. I won the last time i played yet still was left feeling kinda frustrated & unsatisfied. Doesn't really feel very interactive despite competition for timing of worker placements, the shared card market, & the occasional card that lets you mess with your opponent's tableau.

2439,GoingTopShelf,6,"There's a good game in here somewhere, but there are better card tableau builders out there. First, I dislike the mechanic where everyone can be in a different season depending on how you pace out your actions. In one of my games, I finished 35 minutes before the other players and had to wait around until they finished up. Granted, I played very poorly, but it's poor design to leave a player potentially passive for that long. Second, there is very little player interaction. Unlike a game like Underwater Cities where the board play is critical and tension is high that someone might take your spot, here there is none of that. The basic and forest spots are almost never used, or certainly not used enough to create any real tension. Finally, if you have players of different levels of experience, it's not going to be enjoyable for all players. The knowledge of the cards is critical and if you don't know how the cards work together or how to effectively build an engine, you are are going to get crushed. None of this is unique to Everdell, but other games make up for this by allowing a higher degree of player interaction to mitigate those effects. Here there is none of that to help the less experienced players.",199792

2473,grasa_total,4,"It's so pretty! But, like a lot of tableau builders, its last act was a slog of mathing out the opportunity costs to play different cards, a lot of which work out to the same thing.  Also, when I read about the ""Husband & Wife"" controversy beforehand, I didn't expect it to bother me. Some of my closest friends are straight! But in fact what the game encodes is not just that some of its characters are in husband/wife marriages; it's that that is what homestead farms are FOR, and that a wife is simply what GOES WITH a husband, as surely as an inn needs an innkeeper or as athletes need one another in order to compete. It holds up male/female relationships as simple, as being no drain on the game's cognitive budget. THAT is not so great.  (And when the husband and wife find one another and pair off, the husband becomes a productive farmer, while the wife... is just worth more points? As someone pointed out, she is literally a trophy wife.)  (Good gameplay can outweigh a lot of this type of thing; for better or worse I'm ready to spend a lot of my ""ignoring casual oppression"" points on playing board games, because I love trying new games, especially by new designers. But game design is hard and new designers often NEED the benefit of the doubt from players because of a wide variety of rough edges. Coding sexism and mandatory heterosexuality into your game sacrifices that benefit of the doubt from some people and I'm not sure I see why it's worth it.)",199792

This plays best with fewer numbers and suffers from downtime as with most engine builders. The combos are easy to spot and enjoyable to pull off, but are only simple short-term rewards. Even though they are quick and easy to set up, there is too much text at too small a font on each card. Too much reading and re-reading card abilities for the levity of the game. The variable player end-game condition is novel. It is neat that each player sets his own pace, but this tends to punish players out of game if they finish early or are the only ones left playing. Engine builders have a difficult task of finding the balance between player's satisfaction with their engine and downtime.

2521,Grunt778083,9,"I love this game. It seems I am having a fable for Worker Placement combined with some kind of card play. And this one is exactly doing that. A nice Worker Placement game with Hand Management and Tableau Building. The game and illustrations look amazing. It's just fun to look at the illustrations and find different details (Did only I miss for so long, that on most building cards also the creature can be found, which can be played into that building for free?). But don't be tricked. This game is much more complex as it may look like. It is neither a kids nor a family weight game.",199792
2522,gryvon,9,Really fun resource gathering and worker placement game. The art is fantastic. The game seems like it'd be over quickly at first but there's a lot of strategy involved in the later stages of the game.,199792
2523,Grzdyll,7,"Game which probably every geek know. Since I'm careful about too ""hyped"" games I was not very convinced to buy my copy but when I one day found good offer I finally decided to buy it. Unfortunately the tableau-builder games don't hit my table often so I was afraid that it also will not be warmly welcomed but aside from the fact that the sweet components in fact stolen our hearts the game itself is really pleasing, even if the luck is important factor here.",199792

2528,GSReis,3,"Definitely a triumph of form over function, especially with the enormous cardboard tree and lots of cards with text in a tiny font. Some small cards placed on the branches of the tree are even harder to read.  Mechanically, despite a bit of novelty in mixing worker placement and tableau building, the game is very bland, with workers being mostly used to get the resources needed to play cards. To make it worse, some cards add annoying take-that effects. I lost because of one of them, as the card (worth negative points) is played in an opponent's tableau and it took my last available building spot. Being artificially limited to 15 cards and not being able to discard from your tableau even at a cost, except with some rare card effect, is a flaw in itself. Luck of the draw is huge, with card combos and public goals depending on specific cards. And the rules are sometimes vague, even though it's a very simple game.  It doesn't feel as amateurish as other Kickstarter projects, but let's be honest: it only stands out amidst the mediocrity because of the cutesy animal theme, pretty (not great) artwork and, of course, the unneeded tree. I like the custom playing pieces and resources, though, which are quite refreshing after so many games with generic meeples and cubes, but the rolling ""twigs"" are a nuisance.",199792

2542,Gurneywars,10,"Collector's edition.  The game play is pretty smooth and straight forward.  the artwork is just amazing.  The deluxe resource counters are top notch.  This is a worker placement game to gain resources to play out cards that are used as critters or constructions in your little city.  It takes four seasons(rounds), with players taking turns until they all pass for the next season.  The cards and critters and bonuses have victory points for the end of game.  The person with most points wins.  Edit 3/24/19:  After so many more plays the cons, such as luck of the card draw, or being to light are rather mute.  Any game with cards or dice has a luck factor in the game.  This being light to medium Euro game makes it more readily to hit the table with my family, especially with the beautiful artwork.  The tree is never in the way, but I am a gamer and have a table for games.  With the new expansion in the works so 5 players can play will only add to the draw for it to hit my table.  With a wooden tree on its way i won't have to worry about the cardboard tree wearing away anymore.  I have upgraded my score to 10 from a 9 because of the amount of fun this game has been and how much it gets replayed.

Many comboes are possible and after many many maaaany games, I fail to see even 2 same cities ever. The game is highly replayable and is a nice relaxing multiplayer solitaire. There's really few cards/actions that will make you interact with your opponent's town and it is fine.

Nice synergies between cards can lead to very satisfying turns. And despite not having a lot of player interaction, it still feels tense and very competitive.   There are 2 minor flaws though. Firstly, the so-called 'analysis paralysis' may be quite a common occurrence, especially for new players. And secondly, the 'Jester' card just isn't any good here - it is the only negative interaction card in the entire game and can really screw you over by a total surprise. It wouldn't bother me if the game was more heavy on negative interaction, but as just a one-off it feels unbalanced and unfair.",199792

Although it does in fact have a huge tree, it is quite a satisfying game with deep levels of strategy.  My favourite element is that each ""construction"" card allows you to play an associated ""critter"" card for free. There's something deeply satisfying about finding the pairs and playing them!  I feel the game also has a lot of player agency as a result of the bad size as well as the ""meadow"" cards which are a sort of shared hand among all players of 8 cards. This means you always have plenty of options.  I enjoy showing this one to casual gamers as a sort of gateway game.",199792

After a few plays, the game revealed a bit more depth than what was first apparent to me. The limitation of how many cards you can have in your city forces interesting decisions. Do you want to quickly put out low scoring critters in order to fulfill pubic objectives or do you focus on building economy in order to put more expensive stuff in play. If you focus too much on economy your city will be overflowing in resources but not have enough of the point scoring cards. Add to this some cards that have the ability to remove other cards from your own city. There is an interesting balance to strike between economy and scoring points and when to switch from the first to the second.  Cards that initially seemed ""meh"" have turned out to be useful after a couple of plays.  Replayability is good. Some of the action spaces are randomly selected during setup which makes the availability of resources different from game to game. That slightly shifts the value of different actions and cards. Player cards and general strategy started to feel familiar after about three games. I still felt like there was lots of combos left to try out though.",199792

There are a plenty of interesting decisions to make, the component quality/artwork is surprisingly great, and the theme is relatively accessible. The gameplay itself is super smooth. I dig the shared market and the use of the 7 Wonders 'Tech Tree' system. This, combined with the automated growth of your worker pool, makes the game have a natural power 'arc' which is quite satisfying.

2728,hozokauh,8,"I am 3 games in and am delightfully pleased with how overwhelmingly simple this game is. It is the best introductory-level game for explaining worker placement, card play, and city building at the same time.   Despite three board game genres in one, it remains very straightforward. On your turn, you can do two things: place a worker, or play a card. That's it - and it really helps eliminate the analysis paralysis that other games of the genre are prevalent with.  Even the peripherally portions of the game are great - the theme and art is delightful. The replayability is varied (rotating quests and forest tiles) and rewarding (recognizing powerful combos, or stages of the game). The game is even pretty quick, too.  The only thing holding this game back for me is that it can feel very random at times. I do believe the best player will win out over multiple games, but in an isolated game with an attentive player you can definitely win on luck alone. With >2 players, action spaces feel like a lottery. Being able to play a critter for free due to having the construction is also very strong, compared to the ~2 actions it takes to normally build one.   Overall, 8/10. Highly recommend.",199792

It's a pretty good tableau builder and I do like the cards and resource management side of it but the worker placement side of it just feels pretty lack luster. The places you can go to initially just feel underwhelming. Once the game starts picking up speed though it can be really good. One major issue I have with playing it at lower player counts is that it can be very lucky in that you may never see half the deck. This makes the goals to get certain cards impossible. This is mitigated in the 4 player game because you have lots of people that are cycling through the deck and pulling from the meadow. I'll keep it for now because I pulled some father's day gift strings for my wife to let me buy it but if it's a worker placement game I want I'd rather play Lost Ruins of Arnak, Tzolk'in, or anything Rosenberg.

2812,IllusionKnight,7,"Good worker placement with some unique mechanics and some unique criticisms. The hibernation/season mechanic is great as there are 4 phases of the game (one for each season) but each player might be in different seasons. Since you return workers (animals) at the end of each season, and the slots of each activity (usually gain resources) will change at various points in the game as to whether or not they are empty or full, adding to layers of strategy.  However there is an imbalance in the number of workers you get during each season. During the earlygame you are very limited in the number of workers you can place (2), which severly limits how many resources you have in the earlygame. On the otherhand you have way too many workers (7) during the endgame and not nearly enough useful actions for you too take at that point. Whilst the former is usually and fine, the too many workers at the end weakens the fun of the endgame.  To compensate for the low workers, many cards have a 7 Wonders style effect where you get cards for free (not all but quite a lot) if you own another card e.g. the Husband and Wife cards you get for free if you own a farm. This creates interesting synergies you use to acquire resources/points and form a core part of strategy in Everdell.   To add onto this, in addition to the up to 8 cards you get 10 cards as an open hand to everyone, meaning you can play the cards provided you meet the requirements of the cards. There aren't a lot of ways you can add these cards to your hand, other than the third season (where you add too). This open hand adds to everyone's early game strategy and can be used as a disrupter.  However a side-effect of the too few workers/too few early-game resources (and relience on card combos) is that this can define the early game, unless you are lucky to get the cards in your hand. Using the open hand there will be only one or two early game combos, and if you don't get them, it has a dire impact on your viability to win the game.  Another issue with the too few workers mechanic, is that one of the resources (stones) are particularly limited, and there are very few tiles/cards that produce them, particularly in contrast to the number of cards that require them as a resource.  The five types of cards you get are an interesting set which adds different benefits to your limited realm (you can only play up to 15 cards, mibnus some cards which don't take up a space). You get green icon cards that net you a small boost when activated (or Spring/Autumn season); brown cards that net a one-time effect; blue cards that have a passive boost e.g. draw a card everytime youm play a critter); red cards that net you a worker placement zone that either only you can use or opponents can also use (and you get VP), and purple end-game cards that net you Victory Points depending on whether or not you meet certain requirements.  Speaking of endgame there are two types of big end-game scorers (other than purple cards) you can get by using a worker slot, and only one person can obtain. There are ""lesser"" values in which you get 3 points for having 3 of the same type of card (e.g. Green; Red). There are also ""greater"" values for usually owning two cards with certains names e.g. Doctor and Farm in which you get 9 points. I have no problems with the 3 points bonus, but the 9 scorer placements are way too restrictive and have no synergy and as such are very rare too see.  + Unique ""seasonal"" based mechanics. + As such, more strategy in your worker placements. + Good open-hand mechanic. + Wide variety of cards and combos to implement. - Early game combos are limited, and often gives one/two players and advantage. - Stones are a very limited resource, compared too how much you need from end. - End-game cards a very badly handled and have too difficult of requirements to get. - Number of workers you get are imbalanced.",199792

2814,ilopez10,6.6,"Un juego de combos y colocación de trabajadores con influencias de otros juegos como Wingspan, Imperial Settlers,  San Juan o Terraforming Mars.   Ambientado en la construcción de una ciudad (=un despliegue de 5x3 cartas) y de sus habitantes animales (cartas con ilustraciones realmente evocadoras). Los jugadores juegan trabajadores para conseguir recursos o construyen cartas. Cuando construyen determinados edificios, pueden invitar a sus moradores a vivir en ellos. Es decir, si construyes “el juzgado” puedes “invitar” (=jugar gratis) al juez. Una vez que se han jugado todos los trabajadores y no se pueden construir más cartas, se ""cambia de estación"" consiguiendo más trabajadores y produciendo recursos de algunas cartas o robando del tablero central. Al acabar el tercer cambio de estación y comenzar un inexistente cuarto cambio, la partida acaba para ese jugador .  La mano está limitada a ocho cartas, las cuales pueden jugarse en el despliegue personal pagando los recursos necesarios, o bien, convertirse en recursos moviendo el trabajador al lugar que permite esta acción. Por si fuera poco, hay un área en el tablero (“el prado”) en el que siempre habrá 8 cartas disponibles a todos los jugadores para su construcción directa. Es como “una extensión de tu mano de cartas”.  Finalmente, hay una oferta de  cartas con eventos que sirven para anotar puntos de victoria de que varía y es distinta en cada partida. Todas estas cosas combinan sorprendentemente bien en un juego “familiar plus” que ofrece gran cantidad de momentos satisfactorios a lo largo de la partida (jugar una criatura gratis porque tienes construido el edificio que lo permite, colocar al bufón en el despliegue de otro jugador, colocarlo luego en la mazmorra para evitarte los dos puntos negativos…)  PROS: Mejora con cada partida, porque comienzas a descubrir combinaciones de cartas que no habías percibido a primera vista. Las ilustraciones son sensacionales y ayudan a introducir a los jugadores en el ambiente. Además, es muy atractivo para recién iniciados porque ofrece pocas acciones a realizar durante un turno (colocar trabajador, jugar carta o cambiar de estación…) El tener a los jugadores en etapas distintas de la partida (algunos pueden estar en primavera mientras que otros andan en otoño aún), da un giro muy particular a la mecánica de colocación de trabajadores.  CONS: A la larga se convierte en repetitivo y necesitará expansiones, porque irás conociendo los combos más productivos.  Algunas cartas están demasiado desequilibradas y hay partidas en las que anotar puntos en los eventos variables depende más de la suerte que de tu estrategia porque son muy estrictos en sus requisitos (tener “la reina” y “el juez”, por ejemplo…) A los jugadores novatos les cuesta captar la esencia del juego porque hay texto en las cartas y demasiadas opciones con las cartas de su mano y las de ""el prado"".  CONCLUSIÓN: Es convincente, pero no aporta nada nuevo al viejo estilo de conseguir recursos--> comprar cartas--> conseguir más recursos gracias a las cartas--> repetir hasta ser el primer jugador en conseguir las cartas de objetivos. No hay demasiada estrategia tampoco, porque la mayoría de las decisiones las tomas basadas en las cartas que tienes en tu mano y en ""el prado"" (y están ahí por mero azar)  Como consejo final: pasad de montar el árbol. Sólo estorba.",199792

The disgustingly overrated Terraforming Mars *wishes* it could be like this.  Rules are quite simple; the learning curve comes with learning the ins-and-outs of the cards and resource management. Everyone will flounder their first playthrough, but things will start to click by the end. Second playthrough I won with a score of 53. Once you find a groove, every move is damn satisfying.  Each play that you make is blissfully excruciating. A single bad worker placement can cost you the game, which is why this is prone to AP and will easily push past the creators' estimated playing time. This should not be a deterrent, however. Relating to my opening comment...despite the large deck, it does not have much of a chance to beat you. You will lose if you cannot adapt. You will beat yourself, but you *will* have fun even if that happens!

One of my main cons, and not a big one, is the space it takes on a table. Since you need to be formed in a semi circle to play it, because due to the tree standee, playing behind it may be virtually impossible, the game may require a tad more than your standard square dining table. I play at a round 36', and everyone can reach and do their thing rather comfortably.   Next would be the actual Evertree standee quality. The punchboard quality/thickness could have been better, but is not the worst either. It seems that after assembling many times, it will eventually get extremely worn. Not the end of the world.  Lastly, on the collectors edition, an upgraded component requires stickers. I think we could have used enough stickers to put them double sided, but alas, only enough to put single sided.

Every playthrough is different based on a number of varying goals and the ways the cards turn out.   One of my favorite things about Everdell is that it's fun whether you win or lose, and you often don't know who the ultimate winner is until the end of the game, though you can tell whether you're generally doing well. There are a few ways to intentionally screw over other players, which can be fun if your group is the competitive sort, but every player will have plenty of chances to add useful or valuable cards to their city, and you get kind of caught up in your own strategy, so it's not as big of a blow.   Everdell is also one of the cutest, best-looking, and most immersive games I've ever played. The theme of building a city for woodland critters is adorable, and all the cards and the board and even the box are covered in beautiful, detailed art I would 100% hang on my wall. You get to choose which kind of meeple to use, and they are all very cute wooden forest animals in a variety of colors. In expansion packs, you will find new kinds of animals to play, and if you have the Bellfaire expansion, your choice will even lend you a special power! In addition, each card you can play has its own special ability, which is related to the character or building on the card. The pieces you will use to build your cities are nicely made and the berries are even squishy, which everyone in my family is obsessed with. You can win events by having the right set-up of cards, which helps you gain extra points. Everything in Everdell plays into the magical woodland atmosphere, and everything is clearly painstakingly well thought-out.   If you are going to buy Everdell, I strongly recommend going with the Collector's Edition, which will get you extra Legendary cards that my family always uses and enjoys, as well as better quality game pieces such as metal coins and wooden occupied tokens, which just adds a special touch. Legendary cards also help each game feel different and make you shift up your strategy a little, because you only get two each at the beginning of the game, and they're mostly expensive, but can confer big benefits.   You should also consider getting some of the expansions if you like the game, because they expand your options and make the game even more enjoyable. Chief among the expansions is probably Bellfaire, which my family never plays without, seeing as it gives you additional powers, goals, and allows for additional players to join in, as well as other additions. I am also very fond of Spirecrest, which makes things more difficult with seasonal weather challenges, but gives you seasonal benefits as well, such as ""Big Critter"" meeples with special powers your meeples can ride. Playing ""Legendary Bellcrest"", as we call it, with the Legendary cards plus the Bellfaire and Spirecrest expansions all together will lead to a longer game, but one with a good balance of helpful boosts and difficult challenges.  Now that Starling Games is coming out with Everdell: The Complete Collection, I can't wait to play the new expansions they are adding, and would definitely recommend getting this version off the bat if you want to save some bucks and avoid buying every expansion separately. Because if you're anything like us, and you like fun, themed, strategic games, you're going to quickly grow obsessed.",199792

From the components to the art, this game oozes its theme and each expansion grows the theme deeper.   The game play is also deeply satisfying and rewarding. Often the first season can feel tight and a little underwhelming and by the end of the game you have to many options. I just think this game is a joy to play.  The only reason it is not a 10 for me is that it slowly becomes a bit same-y with repeated plays, however even just one expansion such as Spirecrest fixes this problem.   (The tree at 4 players can also be a bother as this game can be a space hog. One of the expansions fixes this problem.)",199792

Pros: -The artwork and theme are beautiful, you will never want to put this game away -Lots of replayability. This is a game that you can always get better at and always try new things. -There are a lot of ways to score points that require some intense strategy and concentration -Enough static mechanics to keep things fair, just enough random mechanics to keep you on your toes -There are plenty of expansions to make it so Everdell never gets old!  Cons: -This game is a little bit on the complex side and will require at least one full game to fully understand everything. -Some mechanics can feel a bit clunky with the character and construction effects. This does not effect the game too much as long as your people all agree on how you should approach these situations!

2921,JamesH,7,Beautiful and clever game! All the combo-making is right up my alley and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately I don't think the game will hold my interest after 6-7 plays as there are not many different strategies to try.,199792
2922,jamesjacob,7,"Don't let the charming artwork fool you. This is a fairly impressive game that combines tableau-style engine building with classic worker placement mechanics. On the surface, the rules seem pretty 'I've-seen-this-100-times-before', but the interconnectedness of the cards makes for engaging decisions and pulling off combos is satisfying. Furthermore, it's refreshing to see positive player interaction with cards like: 'give your opponent resources for VPs' and 'draw 2 cards, keep 1, give 1 to an opponent'.  However, there are caveats. One card (The Fool) is oddly mean in an otherwise tranquil set of mechanisms. Certain expansions further promote negative interaction.  Another caveat: in order to achieve the 'special event' cards, you need combos that are very specific. Getting them feels more random than strategic and, for me, they didn't need to be there.  The most serious caveat: there isn't enough cycling of cards in a game that requires specific combos. This means that you may never even see the cards you need as they're buried at the bottom of the giant deck. While one player might benefit from card synergies early in the game, another player might struggle to get any kind of engine going before the second season. In other words, the ""luck"" factor is too high for such an involved game, which means we often chose to play other tableau builders like Terrforming Mars: Ares Expedition, Ark Nova, Earth or Underwater Cities (all of these are less attractive, but better games imo). Apparently Farshore fixes this particular caveat, so I'll be looking to try it out sometime soon.  For the record, I like the tree.",199792

Beim Spieleerlebnis packt mich das Spiel, trotz gewonnener Partien, einfach überhaupt nicht. Die erste Runde (ohne sich die Karten vorher mal an zu schauen) war extrem zäh und hat locker 2 Stunden gedauert. Da Frage ich mich ob die Altersangabe mit 10 Jahren ernstgemeint ist? Ja, die Regeln sich nicht schwer, aber man muss die Karten und Synergien einfach kennen. Mit weiteren Runden lernt man die Karten natürlich immer mehr kennen, aber aufgrund der Hohen Anzahl an Karten muss man taktisch so derbe flexibel sein, dass es mir einfach kein Spaß macht. Im schlimmsten Fall musst du nach jedem oder jedem 2. Gegner umplanen, weil er entweder a) dein Feld blockiert, b) die Karte von der Wiese genommen hat die du brauchst. Das Spiel ist so derbe unbalanciert....entweder du Spielst mit 4, dann hast du mehr Plätze und die Karten werden mehr getauscht, sind dafür aber auch schneller auf der Wiese weg, oder du Spielst zu zweit, hast weniger Plätze und die Karten liegen gefühlt eine Ewigkeit. Bei 2 Spielern hatten wir sogar mal das Problem, dass jeder das gleiche Einzigartige Gebäude in der Stadt hatte und auf der Wiese lag das gleiche nochmal. Das macht einfach keinen Sinn. Prinzipiell gibt es so viele Möglichkeiten im Spiel zu Gewinnen, dass es kein Glücksspiel ist, aber wie du zu deinem Gewinn kommst, das ist wiederum reiner Zufall. Ich würde dem Spiel gerne noch mehr Chancen geben, aber das mit dem immensen Zufall stört mich einfach und die Thematik ist generell nicht so meins, wobei ich dafür keinen Stern abgezogen habe, denn da kann das Spiel nichts für.",199792

I don't want to buy expensive expansions to ""fix"" this when they add time and complexity to something marketed as family-weight.  This is for those at the stage that these mechanics are still novel, or those for whom the charm compensates for the unoriginality. I just happen to already find many other tableau builders more satisfying and/or less tedious. The only reasons I kept it this long were its art and hype.  Publisher's marketing prowess won over in this one. I actually would've liked the designer's original vision of Race for the Galaxy meets Agricola.

2996,jdien07,8,"Everdell is a nice fast but not light worker placement/tableau building game.  Over four seasons you place workers to get resources that you can then use to place cards from your hand into your tableau, representing constructions (buildings) and critters, both of which give you victory points and also special bonuses.  This enables you to come up with interesting combos and so forth.  There is also competition to achieve various ""events"" that are worth points (like the first to get three of a particular type of card).  A nice feature is that in addition to one's hand of cards, there is also a meadow with eight cards that everyone can use as an extension to their hand.  This helps buffer the luck aspect of what cards you draw.  The variety of changing cards, events, and special worker spots provides a fair amount of replayability.  There are also a number of expansions which should further increase interest, although I haven't had a chance to try them yet.",199792
2997,Jdkberg1,8.5,"Below is my review following my first play. After a second go, I can say that the game is growing on me.  The tight feeling at the start of the game soon gives way to a productive engine (if you play your cards right) and extended play in the summer and autumn. Competition for basic and special events mitigates against solitaire play, as you do have to keep an eye on others to know when you need to scoop up an event. I stand by my earlier opinion that the game does not present anything new by way of mechanics but what it does, it does well.  There is a satisfying feeling connected with gathering the right resources in the most efficient way.  Proper planning does payoff in the end. This is a good family game, great theme, excellent table presence.  I’m sure we will play it many more times and probably try an expansion.     (First review)This is a game of engine building and reminds one of both Wingspan and Dominion. Plus a sprinkle of San Juan.  All of those games reached favorite status so Everdell should be at once familiar and new, but is it a sum of its parts?  We only have one play in, and there is potential. I’m going to give it that chance. My concern, is that initially it feels like a mash up of very good games without offering anything new or unique.  But after one play, I can’t be certain. Don’t get me wrong, the game is fine but will I need to spend $$$ on expansions to make this particular game shine on its own?   ",199792

3002,Jedadeana,N/A,"(M's) Cute worker placement card tableau game. I love the tree! I enjoy the ""Redwall"" atmosphere (but more peaceful). Base game is a fairly straightforward worker placement but it also has tableau building with engine building. Fairly tight game where things feel impossible first round but then ramp up quick as you're able to chain things and get more resources later on. Good ""light-medium"" game. The tree display is awesome (probably my favorite thing in this game) and the animeeples are adorable. Nice art, but text is way too tiny on parts of cards. Haven't tried any expansions yet but I'm looking forward to playing with them soon!

So you pay for the structure and you get to play the matching critter for free (teacher/school) Some are unique and some are common.

Especially when you play with 3-4 players.  Only played solo or with 2 players. As a 2 player game it's great. Really like the idea of passing through the seasons at your own pace and trying to build the best city possible. My least favorite aspect of this game are the most of the time useless special event cards. There are simply too many cards too get the needed combinations for these events. Especially in solo mode getting these special events is very important because else you automatically give 3/6 points per event to Rugwort. I wouldn't recommend it as a solo game.",199792

3046,JevVoi,6,"Attracted by the ""Redwall"" aesthetic and the frequent comparisons to Wingspan. This was my first experience with worker placement. I played a solo game and a multiplayer game. The solo game left a great first impression, I was not super interested in the worker placement aspect but I liked the ability to combo cards and abilities to stretch out my resources. I also liked the buildup.  Playing the multiplayer game as a learning game there was a skill gap resulting from one player picking up on this a round sooner than the other. This resulted in the one player walking away and taking a phone call while waiting fifteen minutes for the game to finish. The worker placement aspect was slightly more interesting due to the decision of when to pull workers off for the end of season action. The worker placement still was less interesting to me than playing the cards. The multiplayer game was enough to sour my impressions of the game.  I enjoyed the game and appreciated it enough to recommend it. However I found that what I enjoyed most about the game was present in other games I liked more. I would be willing to come back to this game and would probably really enjoy it if someone else wanted to play it.",199792

3055,jgoyes,7.5,"2019-10-20  Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2019)  I wasn’t expecting much from Everdell, I don’t know why as the game is very well regarded here in BGG, however, it really surprised me and I really liked it. I will not only keep it but I will also buy its expansions ASAP.  Everdell´s rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is around 2 hours.  The game´s components are very cool. There is a gorgeous big tree on the board and I initially thought it was going to be an obstacle to gameplay, but it wasn’t and it even has some functions within the game, pretty cool. I played the collector edition so I’m not sure how good are the components of the regular edition. The box sleeve is useless to me but pretty.  The art is gorgeous, from the cards to the board everything looks great.  The theme is ok for me, nothing too exciting but it is refreshing and novel.  Everdell is a worker Placement game and a Tableau Building game. I though gameplay was going to be too easy or too obvious as some friends have said that but (fortunately), that´s not the case. The rules are pretty easy but gameplay offers some interesting decisions, they aren’t very hard, but you do need to think them trough. Each turn a player has 3 options:  1. Play a worker (mostly to gain resources and cards).  2. Play a card to your tableau, this gives you VPs, resources and abilities. The neat part is that each player has a hand of cards AND a shared hand available to all in the center of the board, this is pretty neat and you get to see many cards each turn, so the luck factor can be controlled a bit this way.  3. You can pass to recover your workers. The way this step work is very novel as you can pass while other players haven’t passed and still continue to play in different seasons. There are 4 seasons and you could be in Summer while someone is still in Winter, that is, after you pass you can continue to play normally unlike most games. It doesn’t make thematic sense, but mechanically it works great and it´s something I have never seen before. I love it.   The game revolves around the cards and how they synergize with each other. You are trying to get the best combos online so luck can play an important role in the game but I’m not sure how much is its impact on the game. I need more plays to verify this point.  As playing a card is (more or less) equivalent to play a worker, having more workers is not a huge advantage (and a default strategy) as in most Worker Placement games and that´s great.  There are a few “take that” cards in the game and I´m not too hot on that, however in our game no one attacked me so I need more plays to verify if it bothers me or not, still, the ""take that"" cards seem out of sync with the theme of the game.  Best with 3 players.  It seems Everdell has a high replay value but, due to my current situation (too many games to play), I (almost) never get the opportunity to play a particular game more than 5 times in a year. In any case, the game now has 4 expansions I believe, so I’m not worried about its replay value (which I´m sure it´s high).   Bottom line, Everdell is a gorgeous game that offers interesting decisions and it´s fun to play so it is a keeper for me. I hope the luck factor doesn’t impact the game that much but I’m still not sure about it at this point. I will buy all its expansions and my desire to play it again is high.

3056,jgunnz,7.75,"Very nice and elegant tableau builder/card combo game with gobsmacking artwork, components and design. It is not only the form but the function that delivers with Everdell.   Pros - First, I love card combo games.  This game delivers in spades.  It is short (only 4 seasons), it is spatially limited (everyone is working towards a max of a 3x5 gird), the action spaces, special events, and meadow cards change from game to game creating some nice variability and tactical puzzling.  Also, it goes without saying, this is probably one of the best produced and most beautiful games I have ever played.   Cons- There are a few cons. One, is there is still some luck in the card draw, some cards you will need to effectively build your city (for example critters associated with buildings you build) may never come out, whereas, through luck, your opponent(s) might have a better synergy between their buildings and critters or special event requirements. The special events are dependent on specific buildings and critter combos which you might not see at all in the course of a given game. Overall, I think some luck is to be expected in card combo games, and here it is best mitigated by drawing more cards. It is not devastating and often just requires a pivot in strategy.  Overall, Everdell is a great medium weight game. The mechanics are simple and streamlined, the card text is the only component that adds some complexity (and thus what keeps it from being a truly light/gateway game) it is good for players you don't like heavy games and gives gamers plenty to crunch on. Kudos to first-time designer James Wilson.",199792

Las cartas tienen efectos bien pensados y equilibrados para que se puedan lograr combos muy satisfactorios.   En realidad, nada de este juego es revolucionario, ni siquiera novedoso, pero la buena producción hace que entre por los ojos con facilidad. Es un ejemplo más de cómo el marketing puede venderte lo de siempre como algo extraordinario. Quizá el hype generalizado ha hecho que mi expectativa fuera demasiado alta con este juego, por eso esta reseña pueda parecer un poco negativa, pero el juego en general me gustó, sinceramente.  No he probado las expansiones, pero se antojan necesarias después de cuatro o cinco partidas porque el juego base no tiene una rejugabilidad muy considerable que se pueda decir.   Un aspecto quizá para repensar: el que cada jugador pase de estación cuando le dé la gana acentúa un poco el ya de por sí marcado sabor multisolitario de este juego. El juego trata de empujar a los jugadores a estar pendiente de las cartas que bajan los demás, con espacios nuevos de acción como reclamo, pero la verdad es que con poco éxito. La carrera por los bonus es otro intento por meter interacción, pero tampoco es muy emocionante.  A pesar de todo, la partida es agradable y competida y aprieta en recursos lo justo para que con tus combos te sientas el rey de la táctica en los juegos de mesa. ",199792

If you draw the right cards to form combos or other players don't take the ones from the Meadow, then yeah, you can do some great combos. Otherwise... sorry. -Prone to AP issues for some. -In a 4-player game we got through the entire (huge) deck of cards, so we literally saw everything the game has to offer. A game that requires expansions for replayability is simply flawed or incomplete.  As with any big, heavy game like this, it strongly favors anyone who has played before. It takes a full game to really understand how the game progresses and to familiarize with the card combos, etc. It's a fine game for gamers, but I hesitate to call it outright ""fun"". Top 30ish game of all time? Eh... I would disagree, but I'd play again a few times, but then you'd need expansions to keep it interesting.",199792

3107,jmhan616,7.5,"This seems a mixture of worker placement & card engine building (it's not deck building, engine builds up as you trigger the construction/critter effect), however, I would put it it's more geared towards card engine building.   At first, winter season, you might get the feeling there's not much to do with two workers, however the critical actions required in the winter is to establish your base of the engine that'll carry throughout the whole year. Depending on which construction cards you build, it's thematic. (We had 4p game one building peaceful village with multiple wife&husband couples, one building ruins and cells to put critters away..(?), one building palace to have a queen, and finally last one built a village with a king)   As the engine builds up, it's natural that you no longer crave for more workers which typical worker placement games you always feel lack of number of workers. As the seasons go by, the game gets longer, but to me it felt steep exponential increase rather than linear increment.  Rules are SUPER SIMPLE for a strategy game, HOWEVER, you need to get used to cards and what combinations you want to plan ahead. It would've been nice if the cards are somewhat all unique, but I guess I'm asking too much. (Felt I might not want to play again again after 10 times)  Components are super nice :) and the evertree too. It's one of my top visually pleasing games as well.    ",199792

3126,joeofthetimelords,5.5,"For some reason this never really clicked for me. Compared to trendy modern games of similar lengths it just doesn't have an interesting decision space. The worker placement isn't particularly engaging, with half the spots redundant and strategic blocking not being particularly relevant.  My main complaint is just that it doesn't feel 'strategic' - you just get dealt a hand of cards and try and use them efficiently - it's more about lucking into combos and free critters (because you coincidentally drew the building it lives in), and while it's entertaining enough, it's just not satisfying at the end when you look at your tableau and it doesn't tell a story of 'your' strategy - it's just the best of the cards you happened to draw. One caveat is that I haven't played with any expansions - perhaps this would improve it, but this rating is for the base game only.  If it wasn't cute and didn't have a million expansions, no one would be playing it - it's simply not as good as the alternatives (literally anything else).",199792

3129,joewyka,7,"Everdell is a bit overwhelming at first blush. The quality production certainly contributes a bit to this feeling, but it is apparent at the outset that the point of the game is to build relationships and combos between the cards that you add to your tableau. End goals are dependent on certain cards coming out and being available to you. When you initially look at your hand and the 8 cards you can build from the table, it is not uncommon to see no combos whatsoever even through you are looking at 14 cards! They will appear however and staying flexible is key. For all of its beauty, this is kind of in the same family as Terraforming Mars and Ark Nova. I really enjoy both of those games and I'd rather play them than this. However, many light- and non-gamers have looked at this and simply said, ""I want to play that."" (Not something I suspect has ever been said from those folks about Terraforming Mars!) There is a strength and power in being able to leverage common mechanisms but to package them in a way that is so appealing while also remaining a solid game design. There is enough game here for significant cross-over appeal for experienced gamers and so the audience for this is obviously huge. If this game gets my wife, or guests, to want to play more games, you bet I'm keeping this around! If I'm with a table of gamers, however, I will make a different choice.",199792

Y el juego visualmente es espectacular.  El juego no está exento de fallos: a 2 jugadores las cartas del Prado no fluctúan, algunas cartas son sencillamente inútiles (Pastor...) pero en general es todo más positivo que negativo.  Además, con la expansión Spirecrest se soluciona otro de los problemas que tiene el base: los recursos que te sobraban al final de la partida. Con Spirecrest puedes montarte un ""camino"" de cartas que te piden recursos para obtener PV y al final de la partida sacarles partido. Además, el juego aprieta un poco más gracias a las cartas de clima que te ponen las cosas un poco más difíciles (hay gente que las odia, ¡a mí me encantan!).  Por último decir, que me parece un juego al que si juegas añadiendo todo el material de todas las expansiones se queda en un pupurri infumable.

3183,JoSch,7,"I was prepared not to like Everdell given its massive overproduction, Kickstarter lineage and catering to everything which is popular nowadays on BGG. But I liked it although only on a good level of enjoyment, not outstanding as its rank indicates.  The tableau building is solid although a slow burner with not much happening in the first and second stage. But things snowball toward the end and the last turns can be a long chaining of cause and effects when having built a synergistic tableau.   The worker placement is tight, especially in the three-player game I played. Probably the best player count giving a good degree of turn-angst while the cards played to the tableau offer enough alternative options to get needed resources or perform actions if you miss out in the worker placement part.  One thing which I generally don't like but which is all too present specifically in modern American games are take-that elements. Quite a few of the cards offer negative (as well as positive) effects targeted at a single other player. We didn't use those too much, keeping Everdell a pleasant experience. I understand that those effects are considered to be a balancing feature but I rather have the game being balanced by the designer.  The single innovation which makes Everdell stand out from the crowd (beside the irrelevant 3D tree) is the way turns work. When you are done with your worker placement for a round, you choose to move to the next round. You will already perform turns in the next round while your competitors can still do turns in previous rounds. This is interesting while at the same time it can have the effect that you are already finished with the game while others continue to play. In our game, one player was finished while we continued to play for around 20-30 minutes (we were slow).",199792

3190,joshua109,7,"Cute through and through, but with a surprisingly sharp gameplay hidden beneath the storybook aesthetic.  Tableau building, engine building, resource management, card management, worker placement, and point salad all come to the fore at different times.  The dynamic card market of the meadow can feel swingy and sometimes harsh; if you've been spending the whole round accumulating resources for a certain card, only to have it snatched away before you can buy it, then you might be left with a pile of resources that isn't good for much else at the moment.  In a game where snowballing is so important, this has the potential to bust your game.  On the flip side, a random card refill could be perfect for the resources and needs that your opponent just so happens to have at the moment, which can feel unearned and unpleasant in a different way.  Similarly, one player may be lucky enough to get the perfect string of structures and corresponding critters throughout the game, while another player gets nothing for free.

3198,jotaaabr,10,"TLDR: Fun game, solid mechanics and incredible artwork. One of the best games to get new players into boardgaming, specially a gf/wife. Easy and fast to teach, not too complex, but not too shallow. Must have in a collection.  It was one of my first boardgames (I think it was my 5th) and my wife's first real boardgame. We both love it! When I got this game I was more worried about HER not enjoying it, so I researched a lot before buying the game, to make sure it was enjoyable and fun, a bit deep but not too complex to the point of scaring someone of trying, but also not too shallow, and I was also kinda new to boardgames, etc.  Everdell hits everything. It has TONS of flavor, really solid mechanics and incredible artwork. In just a couple of minutes you explain the basic rules, in another 5 or so you explain the more complex/specific ones, specially by ""playing"" a quick match to just show stuff in play and some interactions. The board set-up is real quick, just open the board, setup the tree in 3 easy fits, deal the cards, put the resources and workers on the board and go have fun!  A lot of people say that this game is ""just pretty artwork"", that ""the tree is useless"", that the ""mechanics are too simple"", and so on, but what those people forget is that a lot of those traits they call useless give soul to the game, specially in the eyes of those new to boardgaming. Those new players see something pretty, something that SEEMS fun, that looks enjoyable (in Everdell's case, the game not only looks fun and enjoyable, but is), and they are instantly more open to learn how to play a boardgame.  If you want to get your significant other into boardgames (my wife in my case, but could also be some friends, sister, dad, etc), games like Everdell, Azul, Ticket to ride, and so on, are the best path, and if they enjoy those, eventually they will be more open to learn and play more heavy games.  The day I bought Everdell, my wife and I ""played"" 1 quick match just to learn/explain... and then we instantly went into 3 matches, she was hooked, SHE was the one asking for one more match right after the other. It's a must in our collection and get played quite often.",199792

Sometimes the market turns quickly and other times it completely gets stalled.  The different card places and rewards mix up the strategy. In addition, in certain games you will not see the cards you want so you have to create a different engine based on what is available.   Positives -You can have a strategy, yet you must tactically make decisions with what is available in your hand, the market, and with regards to worker placement space.  -Combines tableau building, worker placement, hand management in a nice package.  -Lots of ways to score and many different paths to victory  Potential Negatives -Hard to see the action selection on different cards- you won't know what you are missing if you are new to the game. This includes red cards and playing into spaces in others play areas.  -A lot to take in on initial plays- new players will not immediately grasp the engine building strategies.  -I find that having a bit of analysis paralysis can grind this game to a halt.  -A bit of Multiplayer Solitaire can happen.  -Game can go LONGER than it should -Spend WAAAY too much time milling the deck for certain cards that I want",199792

El juego no terminó de convencerme por que en muchas cartas dependes de que te salga otra para puntuar, ejemplo: carta A da 2 puntos pero da 6 si tenes ademas carta B. y que luego salga B (y no te la roben) es cuestion de suerte. Tampoco me gusta la cantidad de texto de algunas cartas, hace que cada jugador nuevo demore mucho tiempo en leer cada una para tratar de entender como usarlas. Lo considero un juego simple para personas que suelen repetir juegos, entonces ya en un punto se conocen bastante las cartas que hay y no necesitan andar leyendo todo, o saben las probabilidades que hay de que salga esa ""carta B"". Esto hace que sea una ventaja de los jugadores más experimentados con los nuevos bastante amplia. En sintesis, es buen juego pero nada innovador, creo que un 7 le quedaría mejor, pero supongo que el arte y componentes hacen que tenga un 8.",199792

3281,kaepone,7.5,"Grant - Collector's Edition Got this for my 8 year old for his birthday. After one play in which he did surprisingly well, he said this was the best game he had ever played. Lots of variability with setup and many options to build your engine. The lack of workers made me nervous that the building aspect of the game would feel lacking but it was not. I took advantage of buildings that allowed critters to be played for free and quickly filled my city.  After repeated plays I've continued to do well, but there are some issues that I think should be pointed out.   1 . The meadow needs a better refresh mechanism to keep it from stagnating.  2. Card draws are absolutely necessary to cycle through chaff and get useful (to you) cards. If you don't have a method to do this early game you're likely going to lose because you'll be stuck with suboptimal card choices all game. 3. The Open cards that players have are rarely worth going to unless it's the last round because you will lose your worker for the rest of the game.  It's also hard to see those locations, which Pearlbrook helped fix with ridiculously huge 3D signs. 4. Speaking of seeing, getting more than three people at the table is impossible due to the 3D tree that is a huge gimmick and the increasingly growing tableau of cards that will eat the table in front of each player.  Four is doable if you play without the tree (my preference for any player count).  Expansions add more players but I'd never play with more than four due to downtime. It's still at a 7.5 for me, so a pretty good game.  The expansions add some twists, but if you don't like the base game none of the expansions will fix it for you. --------------------------------------------------------------- Collector's vs Retail: metal coins are nice, as are additional critters and cards that add some variability.  If you're going to play this one often, you should probably hunt around for a bargain and pay extra for the Collector's, otherwise Retail will be just fine.",199792
3282,KageSasurai,7.5,"I enjoy this game, its a fun engine builder, feels a little bit like Terraforming Mars light, with worker placement. The problem is, the game is a little too luck based, and the best strategy can be easily blasted out by another person pulling the cards you need before you can get them, and certain cards are nearly mandatory to max endgame scoring; the dungeon, ruins, university etc. and if another player pulls them before you, you're just straight up SOL.

I think its a solid game, easy mechanics, stunning artwork, and I definitely bought it because of the hype, and it was good, but this just isn't for us anymore, I almost don't want to see i on the table anymore, but I'll chalk it up to not being able to find any expansions either to retry, but base game, just not it for us anymore. The game can be quick which is good, but with AP players, downtimes can get huge.   We HAD this on our 12x10 challenge, but after our last 2 games took almost 2 hoursish each beacuse of AP players, we've axed it for something else.

I think it would easily make its way on my Big List of Games To Start With or whatever I'd call my list of games for people who want to get into modern board games; it's the kind of game where you come for the art and the table presence, and you stay because the game is so fun. That's a great combo to have, as I can't say every game has a perfect track record in that department. It's also got a rich bit of worldbuilding around it (as evidenced by the rulebook), so I'm kind of hoping that this isn't the only game set in this universe (or really I'm hoping they continue to pay Andrew money to make more art for this game). Either way, I'm super glad I picked it up when it was on Kickstarter, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the expansion changes the game. If you enjoy a worker placement game with striking art and phenomenal table presence, or you just really like ... woodland animals, I'd definitely recommend checking out Everdell!""

I can't wait to implement the assymetric gameplay of the expansions, and discover the endless possibilities this game has to offer with all those expansions. I wouldn't have invested such a huge amount into the game if it wasn't for the fantastic, simple base game.

3332,kaszkiet,9,"2019-02-22 - 7.5 - A very pleasant to play worker placement with fantastic artwork. It's interesting that at the beggining you have a very few workers and you want to do everything, but near the end you could do everything, but you are limited to a few remaining free spots on your tableau. There are some interesting twists (advancing to the next season while opponents still play previous, cool interactions between the cards) and overall it's a game, which doesn't stay behind its looks.  2020-02-05 - 7.5->8 - Oh, it's a fantastic game. It consists of - you could say - an ordinary (except for the artwork) parts of a modern board games - worker placement, playing cards, gathering and spending resources and getting points.

The pace of the game is masterfully done.

Ultimately, like most of these things, you should just play race for the galaxy instead.  Edit: I’ll try not to rant about too much more but I had very similar complaints. Some of it might also have been down to playing it between Santiago and Roll for the Galaxy (one is my favourite games and the other actually understands what engine building games should be).   1) overall production: stupid useless tree that literally just gets in the way. Super small text + hard to read fonts + a game that almost entirely depends on reading the text. One component literally rolls away!   2) the game is aggressively solitaire. Our only interaction was either accidental (“oh you took that card but I needed it because it randomly combos with a card I drew on turn one!”) or one player reminding another player it was their turn.   3) it’s all just about converting resources into points by building randomly drawn cards or from claiming random bonuses that are tied to the random cards. The entire strategy seemed to be get good cards in your opening hand and then get good cards randomly from the market. The actual worker placement gaining resource system seemed almost pointless.   4) maybe if this game was ranked in the 800s I wouldn’t care but this thing is one of the best games of all time?!

The game is a really resource-scarce game and most of what you do is scrape, scrounge, and barely get by with any and all resources you can gather. So by that extension being able to play a card for free (what happens when you combo a card) is a HUGE savings and benefit, arguably it's one of the strongest things you can do in the game. Which is the pain point of my comment; if you can't get the cards that pair together the game is incredibly limiting, and can feel like crap all game as you pass and everyone else takes an additional 10+ turns.",199792

3413,Kill_Gil89,6,"I have very mixed feelings about Everdell. To me it's one of the most overrated games on the market right now. I feel that if it had a different theme and different artwork this would be a pretty awful game and wouldn't have been nearly as successful as it has been. Mechanically speaking I think it's just not very good.  As a worker placement and engine builder I would rate it just a little worse than average. Every game I've played I've just felt a bit frustrating. There's too many useless cards and not enough ways to cycle through them, especially those on display in the meadow. You are in many ways bound to the luck of your draw which I don't like.  The adventure cards on top of the Evertree you might as well forget about as well, they don't give you nearly enough points for the effort in claiming them (again mostly if you're lucky)  It gets a higher score than I think it really deserves because of the artwork and the theme and the production value, which are some of the lovliest I've seen in a newer game. It's cute and cuddly and looks so beautiful all set up and for a lot of people that will be enough to make it a great game. Sadly not me though.

The game does play the same, but the strategy is a bit different, and doesn't feel as natural.  For instance, rather than having the AI workers be placed randomly alongside you, they are all placed in the exact same spots at the beginning of each round (though are rotated).

Luckily there is YouTube!  I love the idea of city-building and matching constructions with their critters. Not only is the artwork superb but also the details on the cards, like the amount of that particular card in the game, and the visible critters on the construction cards who are doing their thing nonchalantly.  I have all 3 expansions already in my collection and will start with Bellfaire soon. Fun times are ahead with all those expansions that will undoubtedly make the game a lot more thematic/fun/strategic!

I find the worker placement element dull, however - that’s the way I generally feel about worker placement - and the way the cards link together in pairs feels pretty restrictive, you’re just waiting for the pair to come up - I’d prefer a bit more versatility. I liked it a lot at first, but then got a bit bored of it - ended up deciding to sell it.",199792

Critters and constructions stack together to make for some really interesting decisions in this game.  I was actually surprised by how heady this game was on my first play. Similar to Agricola, in Everdell, you begin the game with a large hand of cards and 8 public cards on the board in the ""Meadow"" area. In order to make the most of the game, one really has to internalize the meaning of all these cards. Definitely makes the game tough for newer players.

The rating may change then.   Overall a great package, good components, looks stunning and attractive.

3536,Kromlek,8,"Initial impressions: Solid game, like the buildings giving free critters like 7  wonders build chains. Tough choices when trying to figure out what you want to have in your town and what you won't have room for. Nothing super special/unique about the mechanics/feel for me, but it does everything well.   Biggest, this game is usability. The text on cards is too small, and in a font that makes it almost impossible to read when a card is sitting in the middle of our regular gaming table (says wife with 20/20 vision).  Placing point cards on smaller sized cards and also elevated from the focus of the table is begging for them to be forgotton. I only remembered them in 1 game so far because I wrote them up on the whiteboard in our game room. The tree is just bad for a 4 player game because it blocks peoples' vision if the board is in the middle of the table or else the board has to bee too far a way to reach/read things. Also putting the tree together is annoying, but it's necessary since it has important info. I'll probably just play with the middle piece laying down  Many cards like farm could have simplified their text to just a symbol and have a large amount of whitespace where the ability could be enlarged.   For me, there are too many things competing for my focus. By the end of the game I've got 15 cards in town to remember all of the abilites that are triggering, I've got a handful of cards to know as well as 8 cards on the table that are constantly changing, and of course 10-20? worker placement spaces. I'll always forget either the basic events or special event tiles  Dune imperium does a fantastic job of segregating it's worker placement spaces into categories, then limiting which spaces will be available to you each round based on your hand of cards. This way the number of spaces isn't overwhelming as you split your focus between that and the rest of the game.  Hey the artwork is great, points for that. The resource components are great as well.  Play without the tree, just lay the middle section down to keep track of seasons and place the event cards on it. Makes it much easier to setup and those cards are more visible.  Overall I do enjoy everdell quite a bit. It's the kind of game where if you play your cards right you can keep going and going when other players have finished the game. I like that there are a bunch of different cards but you can only have 15 in a city so everyone's city will end up being different. ",199792
3537,Krotack,8,"Thematically this is one of the best games in my collection. The art is beautiful, and the stylization fits perfectly with the overall idea.  There are a few issues with this game mechanically, unfortunately. The first is card milling. You get a massive deck with many repeats in it, however it's entirely possible to play a full game with 4 people and still not draw the card you were waiting on or needed.  The second issue, which is strategically much more limiting is the minimal amount of turns you actually get to play before the game is over. I always feel like I don't get enough turns per season, especially the first season. The first season expires for most people before you get the chance to play a single card.  The real issue with how short the first season is would be that it's one of only two seasons that allow you to produce resources. Production on cards only triggers twice in the game, once at the beginning (effectively) and once almost at the end, when it's almost too late to even need to collect. As a result of this you spend most of the game not being able to do much because you're resource limited, and you'll spend most of your turns trying to get enough resources to play cards. The entire mechanic feels limiting. You will really only trigger resources once, and by that time you should already be focusing on putting critters up on the board to gain victory points.  I would love everything about this game if there was maybe 1 more season (say Winter for example) and more turns per season, especially at the beginning of the game. Especially if there were more ways to remove cards from play (exile) or perhaps with a larger play-limit of 20 cards instead of 15.  Overall this is still a really good game that would need some tweaking to get me to keep coming back to it. At least the game feels original every time I play it, and it only takes about an hour with two people.",199792

3573,LabRat002a,6,"I know a lot of people love Everdell, but it falls short for me. The game is cute, but I'm not drawn to it. But I generally do love worker placement games, as well as games which you have to puzzle out the best way to combo cards, both of which are strong in Everdell. And I usually do quite well at the game. My problem with Everdell is that I feel like luck plays into it too much, in a way that stings. You can play a critter for free if you already played its associated location. But the deck is huge, and you might not see that critter. Or someone else may grab it before you. Resources are tight, and it is painful when someone takes a space before you. Some cards trigger at the start of two of the seasons, and it's painful if you just miss playing it before you have to pull your workers back and enter the next season. The first season feels so short and makes you wonder how will you ever get anything done. And players can end the game at different times, though it shouldn't keep them waiting too long. The game is over produced with a stand up tree that makes it hard to see some of the cards. A lot of my complaints are actually well mitigated in the game, so it does actually play quite well. The meadow has a lot of face up critters and locations that anyone could pay to put into play, and helps you find the matching critters and locations. The free critter play due to location card helps with the tight resources. The card abilities work well together and give you flexibility. Many of the worker spaces are open to any number of players, though they give a low amount of resources. There are some spaces on the board to discard cards for resource and points, but because cards are so flexible, the choices on what to do are deep & interesting. You get more workers as seasons pass and you'll have more cards in your play area that you may combo off of, so you can actually do quite a lot by the end of the game. And the cards on the tree are few in number and don't change over the course of the game, so you don't need to look at them much.

3581,laexpls,4,Update after about 30 plays via app and a couple of plays on the table:   I realise that I despise Everdell and think it's probably the most overrated game of the last five years. It's a cute game with lots of flavour in its design but holy mother of Jesus.. this randomness is unbearable. Even in the base game I felt it all comes down to luck which cards are on your starting hand and which will show up when it's your turn. But with the expansions Pearlbrook and Bellfaire.. this is getting out of hand. Lots of mediocre actions and even more randomness in the game. Dune: Imperium is tightness in a box with a lot of options to choose from.. every single one can be used to your advantage. In comparison Everdell feels loose as fuck and most worker placement spots are worse than the forest spots - so it's kind of obvious what you should choose. It neither feels strategic nor tactical. More like a random chore with neat critters. Also it's way too long with four players (~ 2 hours). It's one of those games which are exclusively living on their great artwork and presentation.   It's not a good game. Sorry.,199792

There was a surprising ""take that"" card that felt a little out of place, but ended up being ok, as players were able to pass it back and forth 4 times.   Good level of player interaction with the ""Open"" buildings, exclusive worker spaces, common event objectives.  It plays (and looks) similar to Seasons, but it ""fixes"" the problem of the draft mechanic, which was always very hard for new players to do well. I would like to experiment with implementing the Meadow Market mechanic in Seasons.  Overall, it's not groundbreaking, but the art is so great that this solid game stands a little above other Tableau builders and on par with Seasons.",199792

3608,larryjrice,8,"I continue to play without most of the take that cards since there are so few. Enjoyed most every game played thus far although I do get get annoyed if there is AP occurring which can happen either due to small print or change in card displays.   FIRST IMPRESSION:  I own the collector's edition. I made the mistake of adding in the mini-expansion cards (not the legendary cards yet) which happened to be the ""take that"" cards. I don't recommend doing so for your first few games as it can be jarring to experience a take that card since there's only a few of them.   First game will likely take a while as you have to get familiar with the cards and read the text. Some questions will crop up regarding how cards interact. You may need to make a table ruling and check online later. Designer is very active on the game page so questions are answered quickly. Art is pretty. Tree was fine but I can see where it could get irritating to put together regularly and could be hard for everyone to see what's on it depending on where they sit (but it looks cool!).   Game feels a bit like Imperial Settlers/51st State in that you are building a tableau and likely will need to play production cards to get enough resources to do what you need and then also building VP buildings and other type of buildings that provide points, ongoing effects, or a one time effect. This is intermixed with a worker placement game which is primarily about gathering resources although there will be places to go on the different city displays and also goals to race for an win by placing your worker. Can be AP inducing initially and there were moments in my first play where players got stuck working through their options with a fair bit of text to read as well. As the seasons/rounds progress, your city will increase your decisions and extend your action choices and more workers come into play.   At the conclusion, everyone in my group of four expressed an interest in playing again - ""but without the take that cards"".",199792

3619,Laszlo_Jamf,1,"This game is so pretty to look at, the components are very nice, the tree is nice (but absolutely unnecessary). In the gameplay, everyone plays the game for themselves and collects a few cards, here and there a combination is created for more points, sometimes someone snatches a card from you or occupies a space that you would have needed for your next combination... this is not player interaction, by the way. Since I discovered 18xx games, I know what player interaction means, it's moments where you want to go for the other player's throat at the same time and get a high five because his action was so brilliant, where you have to react to the other player's move, who in turn has to counteract it, and you have to react again yourself and so on.  Games like Everdell and alike, I get so bored of these types of games. Of course you can have a good time while you're playing it, but it's not the kind of thing where after a board game evening I think, wow that was a great evening, we learned a lot during the game and we'll have to find a new date for the next one soon!

3649,Lecaro,8,"Kurzrezension ""Everdell"" lebt von der bildschönen Illustration und der liebevollen Gestaltung des gesamten Spielmaterials. Im Grunde ist es ein recht einfaches Worker-Placement Spiel mit Set-Collection Mechanismus und sehr einfachen Regeln.  Spielablauf Die Spieler setzen reihum ihre Arbeiter auf Aktionsfelder, um dort Ressourcen oder zusätzliche Handkarten zu erhalten. Alternativ können sie ein Gebäude oder einen Bewohner aus ihrer Hand in die eigene Dorfauslage spielen. Dafür werden die zuvor gesammelten Ressourcen oder ein passendes, bereits ausliegendes Gebäude benötigt. So kann beispielsweise der Lehrer in das Schulgebäude einziehen, ohne dafür auch nur eine einzige Beere zu verlangen. Die ausgespielten Karten geben sofortige, anhaltende oder zukünftige Spielvorteile und am Ende der Partie Siegpunkte. Kann oder will ein Spieler keine weiteren Karten mehr ausspielen oder Arbeiter einsetzen, wechselt dieser die Jahreszeit. Spielmechanisch bedeutet dies, dass er alle eigenen Arbeiter zurücknimmt und einen bzw. zwei zusätzliche für die restliche Partie erhält. Alle anderen Spieler, die noch nicht gezwungen wurden ihre Arbeiter zurückzunehmen, spielen in ihrer jeweiligen Jahreszeit weiter. Das ist thematisch schlecht zu erklären, macht spielerisch aber durchaus Sinn! Nachdem alle Spieler den Herbst, also die vierte Jahreszeit abgeschlossen haben, ist das Spiel zu Ende und die Siegpunkte der errichteten Dörfer werden gezählt. Der Spieler mit den meisten Punkten gewinnt!  Erweiterungen Die erste Erweiterung ""Pearlbrook"" erweitert das Spielbrett um den westlich gelegenen Teich. In ihm sind Meeresbewohner, mit denen die Spieler Handel treiben können. Zu Spielbeginn erhält jeder eine Botschafterfigur, in Form eines Frosches. Nur diese Spielfigur darf sich auf die neuen Aktionsfelder des Teiches stellen. Allerdings dürfen die Spieler diese Aktionen erst dann benutzen, wenn sie die angegebene Menge Kartentypen im eigenen Dorf vorweisen können, ähnlich wie es bei den 'einfachen Ereignissen' des Grundspiels der Fall war. Diese werden mit der ""Pearlbrook"" Erweiterung durch 'Monumente' ersetzt, die wesentlich mehr Siegpunkte bringen, dafür aber mit jeder Menge Ressourcen bezahlt werden müssen. Unter anderem werden die seltenen Perlen benötigt, die wiederum durch die Aktionsfelder am Teich zu erlangen sind. Um das ganze abzurunden, erhalten die Spieler zu Spielbeginn zwei Schmuckstück-Karten, die sie im Spiel als Aktion ausspielen können, meist eine Perle kosten und dann eine starke Einmal-Aktion zur Verfügung stellen. ""Pearlbrook"" gefällt mir gut. Es eliminiert das stumpfe Setcollection zum Einfahren der Punkte aus dem Grundspiel, mit einer weiteren Aktionsmöglichkeit durch den Botschafter. Außerdem ist das Anhäufen von Ressourcen wichtiger geworden, um die teuren und Punkte trächtigen 'Monumente' errichten zu können.  Die zweite Erweiterung ""Bellfaire"" ist eine Sammlung von Modulen, die mit ins Grundspiel integriert oder weggelassen werden können. Das erste Modul ist ein Marktmechanismus, auf dem Ressourcen erworben oder wieder verkauft werden können. Sehr spannend sind die verschiedenen Rassenfähigkeiten, von denen jeder Spieler zu Spielbeginn zwei erhält und sich dann für eine entscheidet. Dieses Modul führt zum Spielbeginn eine Asymmetrie unter den Spielern ein, deren Spielverlauf von ihren individuellen Fähigkeiten abhängen. Ein weiteres Modul ist ein Kampf um Mehrheiten: Zu Spielbeginn wird ein Plättchen auf das Markttableau gelegt und derjenige Spieler, welcher am Spielende die abgedruckten Voraussetzungen am besten erfüllt, erhält am Ende die meisten Punkte, gefolgt vom Zweitbesten, usw. Außerdem sind noch einige neue Waldaktionskarten und 'spezielle Ereignisse' enthalten, deren Erfüllung sehr viel einfacher gestaltet wurde. Das Spielziel bleibt auch mit ""Bellfire"" dasselbe, die Erweiterung führt allerdings weitere Möglichkeiten hinzu, die eigenen Spielzüge zu gestalten. Das Beste an der Erweiterung finde ich tatsächlich die vereinfachten 'speziellen Ereignisse', die nicht mehr auf bestimmte Karten abzielen, sondern auf grundlegenderes zurückgreifen und damit machbar sind. ""Everdell: Bellfaire"" wird mit Markt, Fähigkeiten und den speziellen Ereignissen weiterhin auf den Tisch kommen. Die Optionen stören nicht, wären aber kein Kaufgrund, wenn ich es vorher gewusst hätte.  Die dritte Erweiterung heißt ""Spirecrest"" und führt mit dem Hasen zusätzliche Spielfigur ein. Diese wird nicht auf Einsatzfelder gestellt, sondern markiert während des Spiels die Jahreszeit, in der sich die unterschiedlichen Spieler befinden. Das ist relevant, da sich ab jetzt das wechselnde Wetter auf das Spielgeschehen auswirkt. In jeder Jahreszeit herrscht ein - durch eine Wetterkarte angezeigtes - Wetter, welches die Einsetzregeln der Arbeiter verändert. So können Waldfelder, einfache Orte oder andere Aktionen teurer werden oder weniger Ertrag abwerfen. Neben diesen Effekten sammeln die Spieler während einer Partie drei Landkarten ein, die bei Spielende mit dem Einsatz von übrig gebliebenen Ressourcen durchlaufen werden können, um weitere Siegpunkte zu erhalten. Dies verlagert das Spielgefühl etwas, da gegen Ende der Partie für gewöhnlich alle Ressourcen ausgegeben sein sollten. Mit ""Spirecrest"" muss allerdings noch das ein oder andere Holz, Harz und Kieselsteinchen aufbewahrt werden. Das Beeindruckendste Merkmal der Erweiterung sind die Riesenwesen, die bei einem Wechsel der Jahreszeit erhalten werden können. Nach dem üblichen Abhandeln der Produktion und zurücknehmen der eigenen Arbeiter, werden drei Karten des Reisestapels aufgedeckt. Alle Aktionen dieser Karten sind durchweg positiv. So können durch sie unter anderem Reittiere erhalten werden, auf die die eigenen Arbeiter gesetzt werden und spezielle Einsatzregeln mit sich bringen. Beispielsweise kann ein bereits besetztes Feld trotzdem benutzt oder mehr Ressourcen eines Einsatzfeldes erhalten werden, usw. ""Spirecrest"" erweitert den Jahreszeitenwechsel und bringt so Runde um Runde immer mehr positive Aktionsmöglichkeiten ins Spiel. Auf der anderen Seite beschränkt es die Spieler durch die Wetterkarten und macht jede Partie variabler. Außerdem rückt das Timing etwas mehr in den Vordergrund. Ich finde die Erweiterung richtig gelungen. Es macht Spaß, mit den großen Wesen individuelle Vorteile zu bekommen, während einen das Wetter plagt. ""Everdell"" wird mit dieser Erweiterung noch größer und spannender, ohne dass viele Regeln hinzugefügt werden.  Die vierte Erweiterung ""Newleaf"" erweitert den Spielplan um den östlichen Bahnhof, auf dem neue Gäste eintreffen, die Siegpunkte im Gepäck haben. Die Gästekarten können mit den neuen Aktionsfeldern auf dem neuen Spielbrett eingesammelt werden und geben beim Spielende wichtige Siegpunkte, wenn die darauf abgebildete Bedingung erfüllt werden konnte. Der Bahnhof erweitert aber auch die Kartenauslage der Wiese um drei weitere Felder, sodass die Spieler eine höhere Auswahl an möglichen Karten haben, die sie direkt ausspielen können, ohne sie auf die Hand nehmen zu müssen. Wird eine Karte vom Bahnhof gewählt, erhält der entsprechende Spieler sogar noch einen Bonus durch das daneben liegende Plättchen. Die beste Neuerung sind aber die Möglichkeiten, die Auslage der Karten auf der Wiese zu beeinflussen. Zum einen gibt es ein neues Aktionsfeld, welches Karten der Wiese abwirft, neu aufgefüllt und im Anschluss welche auf die Hand genommen werden können. Zum zweiten erhält jeder Spieler ein Siegelmarker, mit dem in jeder Jahreszeit eine Karte aus der Auslage reserviert werden kann. Diese Karte auszuspielen kostet danach sogar eine beliebige Ressource weniger, was durchaus entscheidend sein kann. ""Newleaf"" ist mitunter die beste Erweiterung für das Grundspiel, allein schon wegen der Kartenrotation, die die Aktionsmöglichkeiten mitbringen, und so die Optionen auf passende Karten für das eigene Dorf auf einfach Weise erhöht. Mir gefällt diese Erweiterung sehr gut.  Die fünfte und aktuell letzte Erweiterung heißt ""Mistwood"". Das Hauptmerkmal dieser Erweiterung ist der Atoma-Machanismus, der einen weiteren Spieler simuliert und selbst Punkte sammelt. Je nach gewähltem Schwierigkeitsgrad sind die gesammelten Karten des Automas unterschiedlich viele Siegpunkte wert. Der zusätzliche Spieler benutzt die Spinnenfiguren und wird von einem Kartendeck gesteuert, welches angibt, welche Aktionen die Arbeiter der Spinne in ihrem Zug blockieren. Neben diesem Hauptbestandteil sind in der Erweiterung weitere Karten enthalten. Zum einen sind es die sogenannten 'Collin'-Karten, die allesamt einzigartig sind und sich auf den Entdecker des Tals beziehen. Sie sind situationsbedingt durchaus stark, aber auch recht teuer beim Ausspielen. Außerdem werden die acht Farmen des Grundspiels durch individuelle Farmen ersetzt, die unterschiedliche Ressourcen kosten und etwas mehr Ernte bieten, als die ursprünglichen. Die dritte Art sind die legendären Karten. Es gibt davon jeweils fünf Gebäude und Wesen und jeder Spieler erhält zu Spielbeginn eine zufällige Kombination daraus. Diese Karten stellen einzigartige Wesen des Dorfes dar und können ihre jeweiligen Pendants ersetzen oder mit Ressourcen direkt ausgespielt werden. Der Kaufimpuls für ""Mistwood"" war der kooperative Aspekt. Ich weiß nicht mehr woher ich diese Falschinformation bekam, aber das Modul mit den Spinnen kann nicht kooperativ genutzt werden! Nach dem Regelstudium war ich bereits ernüchtert und nach der ersten Partie bin ich mir sicher, dass dieses Modul nicht mehr auf den Tisch kommen wird. Die neuen Karten gefallen mir hingegen sehr. Die legendären Karten werden bei uns vermutlich dauerhaft mitspielen, die Farmen fanden wir ebenfalls sehr gut und die Collin Karten verschwinden im Kartenstapel und tauchen hier und da mal auf. Die paar Karten würden den hohen Kauf aber im Nachhinein nicht mehr rechtfertigen. Wäre mir damals schon bewusst gewesen, was genau in der Schachtel steckt, wäre ich wohl sehr gut ohne ""Miswood"" ausgekommen.  Nachdem ich nun Grundspiel und alle Erweiterungen kennengelernt habe, finde ich ""Bellfaire"" mit die schwächste. Der Markt ist nett, ein Ressourcenbonus ist aber bereits durch die Waldaktionen gegeben. Das Wettrennen um Mehrheiten schränkt die Möglichkeiten der Spieler ein. Auch die individuellen Rassenfähigkeiten konnten mich nicht sehr begeistern, da sie vorwiegend eine Kleinigkeit im Spiel für die Spieler verstärken. Das Handkartenlimit wird erhöht, mehr Karten oder Ressourcen dürfen genommen werden und derlei Effekte sind auf den Karten zu finden. Das Beste an ""Pearlbrook"" sind die Wunder, die den Focus auf Ressourcen legen, dabei den Ausbau der Stadt mit bestimmten Personen abschwächt. Dieser Aspekt ist vom Kartenglück abhängig und sollte daher weniger Sieg relevant sein. ""Spirecrest"" finde ich sehr gelungen. Die Wetterkarten sorgen dafür, dass sich die unterschiedlichen Jahreszeiten auch unterschiedlich anfühlen und ein Wechsel mehr bedacht werden muss. Zudem bringen die Riesenwesen individuelle Spielerfähigkeiten mit. Anders als die Rassenfähigkeiten fühlen sich diese besser und auf den Punkt an. Die Reiseplättchen sorgen leider dafür, dass das Ressourcenmanagement etwas verwaschen wird, da nun am Ende der Partie mit übrigen Ressourcen noch was anzufangen ist. ""Newleaf"" empfinde ich schon fast als essenzielle Erweiterung, da mit ihr die Aussage auf der Wiese besser durchrotiert und nach speziellen Karten für das eigene Dorf gesucht werden kann. Sie gibt den Spielen mehr Kontrolle über die Karten und reduziert damit das Glück, was mir sehr gefällt. Über ""Miswood"" will ich gar nicht viele Worte verlieren. Die neuen Karteneffekte sind toll. Mit dem Automa kann ich nichts anfangen!  Meinung Ein Faktor, der sicherlich viele stören könnte, ist, dass das Spiel für einen Spieler - den vermeintlich schlechtesten - endet, während die anderen immer noch Ressourcen, Handkarten und Arbeiter übrighaben, um weitere Spielzüge durchzuführen und so weiter Punkte sammeln können. Eine längere Partie zu spielen als die anderen, muss allerdings nicht zum Sieg führen. Es kann durchaus sein, dass das Ausspielen von günstigen Karten zu einem größeren Dorf führt und dafür mehr Züge benötigt werden. Dies bringt allerdings verhältnismäßig wenig Punkte pro Karte. Im Gegensatz dazu wird das Ausspielen von teureren Gebäuden und Dorfbewohnern mit mehr Punkten belohnt, bedarf aber einem höheren Einsatz an Arbeiteraktionen zum Sammeln von Ressourcen. Die beste Strategie ist wohl, die Synergien der Karten bestmöglich zu nutzen, sodass so wenig Ressourcen wie möglich bezahlt werden müssen. Dies hängt dann vom Kartenglück ab... Zu bemängeln habe ich nichts. Als störend empfand ich den großen Baum, der beeindruckend am Spielbrettrand aufgestellt werden soll. Dieser ist tatsächlich schön designt, führt letztlich aber nur zu einer Unübersichtlichkeit des Spielgeschehens. Die Aufgabenkarten, die auf ihn gelegt werden, sind sehr klein und der Text darauf noch kleiner. Den Baum einfach wegzulassen ist aber nicht die Lösung, denn auf ihm sind die Angaben für den Jahreszeitenwechsel abgedruckt. Erst die zweite Erweiterung „Bellfaire“ löst das Problem mit der Vergrößerung des Spielbrettes, welches die nötigen Informationen beinhaltet, sodass der Baum nicht mehr aufgestellt werden muss. „Everdell“ hat mich erst nach ein paar Partien abholen können. Nachdem ich den nötigen Überblick über die vielen Kartenfähigkeiten gelernt hatte, konnte ich das Spiel genießen. Jetzt macht es mir viel Spaß, die Bewohner in ihre Gebäude einziehen zu lassen und meine Karten so geschickt zu steuern, dass mein Dorf am Ende hoffentlich das Siegreiche ist. Da „Everdell“ sehr textlastig ist, würde ich zur deutschen Version raten. Auch wenn der Kartentext mit gutem Schulenglisch durchaus zu verstehen sein sollte, ist es gerade für Familien mit Kindern einfach zu viel englischer Text. Da die Interaktion der Spieler verhältnismäßig gering ist, funktioniert das Spiel bereits zu zweit sehr gut. Zu viert ist zwar die Downtime höher, aber dafür tauscht sich die zentrale Kartenauslage eher mal durch. So bildet wohl das 3-Personen-Spiel den Sweetspot. Ich würde das Spiel aber in jeder Konstellation immer mitspielen. „Everdell“ ist für mich ein gelungenes und richtig schön gestaltetes Familienspiel Plus.",199792

Worker placement, resource management, and hand management are some of the most fun attributes in a game for me.

3724,LionPacifique,8,"I haven't yet completely worked out what I think of Everdell. Obviously it's graphically stunning. The gameplay is also worth your time, with an interesting — albeit fairly unremarkable — mix of worker placement and tableau building.  However, for me a few things work against Everdell, at least for the moment.  First is that players ending their games at different times not only feels awkward, but also makes for unexciting game endings that limp to a close (same with the later Tapestry by Stonemaier Games). There's no tension or excitement when one or more players are waiting around for others to finish, and scoring can feel like a relief that it's over.  A second issue is that, while the rules are relatively simple in theory, the rulebook and card symbols are rather poor, and this can make for easy and unnecessary rules mistakes. I don't say this as a complete lightweight — my top ten games of all-time feature multiple Lacerdas, Brass, and Root, and I'm fairly comfortable with complicated rule sets. Everdell's rule difficulty comes not from complexity, but poor communication. Add to this the fact that it's incredibly difficult to walk back turns, and whole games can be (and, in my case, have been) ruined by an error whose fix should have been more obvious in the rules.  Third, the randomness of card draws can make for frustrating games for some players. I am, however, not ready to make a firm comment on whether this is a huge problem. I suspect players need to go in to Everdell not relying on particular cards coming out in a timely fashion, but rather playing in a looser, more tactical manner. Still, one player drawing lots of powerful Governance cards can pretty much decide the game. More plays will tell where I land on this.  When Everdell is played properly, though, it does hum along at a nice pace. That first season with only two workers gives the impression that the game will be over in fifteen minutes. But then you transition to the next season and the game continues to open up. And pulling off nice card chains can be highly satisfying.  I'm still unsure whether the game is varied enough, or whether it has an exciting enough game arc, to make it worth replaying. Maybe the expansions will help out in this regard. Again, more plays needed.",199792

3735,littlechandler,6,"I love the theme of Everdell, but I thought I would find the gameplay mediocre because 1. It seemed like a fairly standard worker placement game, 2. there seemed to be cards that are take that or are arbitrary give things to an opponent, which I don't like, 3. the overwrought nature of the components made me question whether the design would be similarly messy, 4. There seems like there are a lot of cards you have to keep track of, between your tableau, cards in hand, and the 8 in display, which I thought would bog down the game. Well, as for my concerns: 1. The game has much more of a tableau building feel than worker placement, which is a type of game I like more. With 2 players the board definitely feels too open, and while workers can be on a spot for awhile, outside of your initial few turns gathering resources blocking doesn't seem to matter that much. In fact, I almost wish they had just made the game a pure tableau builder, by giving players starting resources, a base amount of income generation, reducing the points values of goals (since you would no longer need to take worker actions to obtain them), and tweaking the additional worker placement action spots that you can build. The worker placement feels a bit superfluous. What I like about the tableau building is, like Imperial Settlers, the card chaining that you can do. The one downside is that the play for free if you have a prerequisite mechanism creates quite a bit of luck in the draw (this presumably is quite an issue too for the goals that require specific cards as well). If the card comes up in the faceup offer someone could hate draft, but if you top deck a synergistic card there's nothing your opponents can do about it. 2. There aren't as many take that or arbitrary give things to one other player as the top BGG images made me think. In fact, since the worker placement isn't that much of a part of the game I wish the game had a lot more interaction, but in a less arbitrary way than take that/give resources to player of your choice. 3. I count the worker placement aspect as overwrought, since it should be better integrated into the game. I also count the arbitrary resource sink in fall of being able to discard cards for points. 4. There are a lot of cards to keep track of, but somehow it didn't feel overly burdensome considering the number. I would definitely not want to play this game with new players or AP-prone players however.  I think this will kill Wingspan for me. Besides liking Everdell's theme more, it has more of a card chaining feel than Wingspan. Also, the reducing number of actions in Wingspan to reduce snowballing feels artificial, whereas the maximum number of cards in play for Everdell makes more thematic sense (you can rationalize it as there isn't enough habitable space for more buildings or animals) and feels less constraining to prevent snowball, as if you have a ton of things that build up your engine you will have less room for point scoring cards.   Compared to Imperial Settlers, I prefer the shared deck over Imperial Settler's unique deck, as since I don't deck construct it feels like there are pre-baked combos each time in Imperial Settlers. Also, lots of the common buildings in Imperial Settlers feel uninteresting and mere stepping stones for the faction-specific buildings. I like the theme of Everdell more. Both games have issues with having arbitrary resource sinks for points. However, I feel like Imperial Settlers has more interesting card chaining, has less lucky card draw, has a little less in the way of cards in effect at a time, and has some of its unique cards have more interesting effects.",199792

Interesting twists on things and the theme really draws you in.  We played it a few times and just felt a bit blah about it afterwards.  It's hard to put my finger on why, but a few thoughts...  The card combinations did add some strategy to the game but it didn't go too deep.  This is probably good game design though, as with the artwork this game is probably going to appeal to a wide audience and many of the people playing are going to be newer to games, or younger or both.  If it's too complex, that's bad (in our specific case though, we want complexity and depth).    The resources are neat and different, but I think the hype that came with the game and other reviewers raving over the berries and the game in general set a very high bar of expectation for us.  We played with just the base game although I did buy Pearlbrook with it.  We tried out Pearlbrook and was underwhelmed for the price we paid for what it delivered.  This however is a good example of pricing a good product well.  Where the mismatch is in my opinion, is that this is going to hit a very broad audience and as such the price of the game is more important.  There are a lot of expansions to the game which require a very heavy investment.  I think that if we were to spend 300-400 on getting the expansions, we would enjoy the complexity more but the base game left us deciding it wasn't worth the cost.",199792

3847,Lusorculus,4,"Everdell is in no way a family game or a gateway game despite being wrongly ranked as such.  Much too heavy for those who aren't seasoned gamers. A lot of text on cards and something like 15 different options at any decision point. In addition, you need to remember to check your cards because they regularly modify certain actions you can do. Not a gateway!   In fact I think Everdell sits at a awkward place where it's still too complex for non-gamers but it likely won't hold gamers' interest for long. There's nothing new here to gamers.  Didn't hate it but expected a lot more because of its popularity. It's a relatively soulless euro. It works but I don't find it compelling, fun or tense. Don't care for anthropomorfic animals, too.

3865,M0oATH,7,"- Writing this review after playing the game once with a 2 player count. - It reminds me of Creature Comfort (resources, set collection through contracts), Stone Age (fighting over worker spaces), and Villagers (set collection through open-drafted contracts, and minimal engine building). Also, it reminds me just a little of Flamecraft. - I think Stone Age’s element of timing which spots to get before the others is so good. Here in Everdell it’s minor  (thought consequential) part. - I think Create Comfort’a excitement of wishing that the gods of the dice have mercy on you is so entertaining. You get to push your luck. - I think that Villagers’s straight- forward “the game is all about building your engine and sets through the open drafting” is a lovely focused gameplay. - Before even doing my first action, I got a bad case of Analysis Paralysis. It’s this kind of game, where you benefit from playing it more and more. In your first turn, you have 10+ different possibilities, as you have 5+ cards in your hands and 8 in the Meadow. - As a heuristic, I prioritized playing cards that are in the Meadow over cards in my hand. I’ve also prioritized playing green cards so I get to activate the ability 3 times (too bad that when you do the first season preparation, you would have only played 1~2 green cards). So according to that, I prioritized for my first turns to be for collecting resources from the forest locations as they are more efficient. After the green cards, I’ve prioritized playing cards like the historian or whatever card that build my engine (make me benefit from doing other stuff). - The red cards (the ones that give “open” locations specifically) are bad for 2 player games, I think. If I played it, my opponent can snatch the place immediately which mostly will benefit him more than it will benefit me. And since we are only 2 players, there will not be enough pulling back. - Playing Constructions that in turn get you to play its critter for free is cool and satisfying. - I like to time pulling my meeples back in a way that prevents my opponent from getting the nice forest locations - Paying full berries to play critter feels bad while knowing that if you had the construction it would have been for free. But sometimes it gives you awesome effect like the Judge for example, so you might want to balance it. - Oh opponent, stop playing the Meadow cards that I wanted! - Historian and Shopkeeper are the best if played at the beginning of the game! - Palace and Castle is are best at the end! Especially if you have the dungeon or whtever cards that make get rid of other cards in your city so you can get rid of early game cards and make place for end-game cards. - So the constructions and critters pair (combo) is a cool mechanic and gives so much theme and is simple enough to keep track of and for pushing your luck for “I hope that card comes” - At the surface level, the game looks complex~deep, but sorry it isn’t. The depth to complexity ratio is weak. Or maybe to be more fair, I wished for the game to have more of the engine building and less of the semi-“set collection”. - I don’t like the limit of 15 cards and the “may not be used with any other card-playing ability”. So limiting. - Everything combos with everything. Oh the events, etc, etc. and the replayibilty with the forest cards. I’m sure there are people who’s this game is their favorite of all time and I totally get that. - It is indeed thematically fun and the art is awesome and so lovable. - Initially it feels like the game is too short, but then turns out it took us about 3 hours to finish playing it the first time. - The game is too much tactical and too little strategic. I think it is so becuase the game lacks the mechanic of contract tiers. I mean, Splendor has small, medium, and large contracts. That introduces long term planning and also interaction because you need to plan ahead all while accounting for your opponents getting first to cards you want. There is another solution which is the “gap” which exist in Tom Lehmann’s games (Race for the Galaxy, Res Arcana, etc) where you have small-cost-small-award cards and big-cost-big-award cards. I think that Everdell by narrowing the combos (you exactly need the husband and the wife at the same time), that they’ve limited the gameplay space that players have. - You could stay with the game for long as there is much to learn with more plays, like depending on your opening hand, how will you play differently? And same goes with available forest locations. As I’ve said, the game is so tactical. But there isn’t too much excitement in it for me. There isn’t that much “Bingo!” as the designer of Qwirkle says. The turns / rounds are so restricting. I mean, the green cards really only get to activate once when I play them and then just once more at the last season (first season practically doesn’t count because you will not have that much green cards then). And the cards combo benefit isn’t that crazy for the risk-reward of the needed combo piece either showing or not in the game to be worth it. If the necessary combo shows, I will only get 1~3 extra points? Hmmm… I’m not sold. - The mechanic of the Meadow is so cool. It’s a smart design solution. It makes more cards show in a game, and makes the game have semi-interaction. Thinking of it, this is just the good old open drafting, but somehow, here in this game the open drafting combined with starting hand cards, is just exciting. Especially that they are placed in the middle of the game thematic board lol makes me feel like they are some weird cards that exist in both my hand and my opponent hand at the same time. - Both the Meadow and the limited resources locations give the game an interesting timing prioritization. Combine this with the set collection and that what makes Everdell as Everdell. The other small locations for end of game points (basic events, special events, the journey) is too small for decision-making to matter. In your last season you just calculate and do. - As a closing remark, I’m giving the game 7 for now but I’m excited to play it again with 2 player count, with more players, and with expansions. Somehow I’m predicting that it will be “once a year game” just like Orleans is for me. Too solved for me. I don’t mean it by the full meaning of word “solved”, what I mean, is that the line of play is already solid in my head. I suffer the same with Res Arcana too. I think that for example Splendor Duel and King of Tokyo for having multiple conditions for victory it keeps me excited and focused and I keep reassessing with every turn. As for Everdell, all what I’m missing for now is “when should I time the switch from engine building to VP harvesting?”. That is true for any engine building game, that you need to perfect when to stop the engine and go for the score. And giving that you’re limited to 15 cards here, you need to think of spaces in your town as a resource just like wood and berries.",199792
3866,mac3uck,8,"Nice setting and beautiful artwork. Gameplay is easy. Even with 3 players it is not very competitive, as you got a lot of opportunities to “make” something useful.

3889,madvogel,9,"I love so many things about this game. The combination of card play and worker placement is so engaging and I'm always finding ways to surprise myself and accomplish what I want even when I'm out of workers or resources. Combo opportunities are widely available and learning where to look and to maximize tight resource engines is incredibly satisfying. The world is stunning and provocative and always excites me and other players to start playing. The components are fun to handle, the board is pretty to look at, and the variety in player meeple designs (with expansions) is a completely unnecessary but somehow appreciated touch.   Speaking of expansions, I would say that's my biggest problem with the game. I dislike how many of the expansions just add complexity and are mostly incompatible with each other. It just makes the game feel bloated. Bellfare and Newleaf are the best expansions for mostly adding more variety to the existing mechanisms, but even they have so many modules that it's hard to get an indication of the ""ideal way to play"". That said, I've played many configurations of Everdell, and they have always felt fun and balanced so it seems the designers knew what they were doing. ",199792

3907,Maitreya,10,"Rating (9) after 4 plays: I always fall head over heels for engine building games, especially if they involve having a hand of cards.  I love all the possibilities of how the hand could play out and trying to prioritize this card versus that card.  Throw in some worker placement and you've really magnified the options for each turn.    Gorgeous production/art, but I hate that tree!  I really like a couple of the worker placement ideas in this game - having spots on cards in your city and locations on the board that vary from game to game.  Allows for quite a bit of replayability and you have to adjust your plans each game, depending on what locations are available.  The 15 card limit in your city adds an interesting little twist to the game.  It's pretty easy to fill your city up so you have to balance how much space you want to dedicate to production cards, end game cards, etc.  One of my favorite games is Imperial Settlers, but I'm pretty sure I can never be convinced to play that with 4 players again.  Everdell looks like it'll be a much better 4 player option.  The combos won't be as crazy and downtime won't be as daunting.    I am a little curious if luck over early production (or lack of early production) will be Everdell's downfall over time.  Some people found that to be a big issue in Imperial Settlers, but I did not.  May end up being the same here, where you have options to mitigate the lack of early production.  However, in Imperial Settlers, you had a lot more time to get your engine up and running.  Update after 26 plays (Rated 10): My appreciation of the game has only grown with more plays.  It reminds me a bit of Race for the Galaxy (one of my favorites) in the sense that you have to make the best with what's available to you and keep your options open throughout the game.  I definitely think my worry about the luck in early production (or lack of) was unfounded.  I've even won games where I've had very little production since I kept my options open and played up the advantages of the cards I did have available to me.    Not 100% sold on the need for expansions.  I have all available.  Pearlbrook will definitely be finding a new home.  Didn't add anything remotely interesting to me.  I'm a big fan of the special powers in Bellfaire, but it may be a bit too pricey for what you get.  I like the new special events, as well.  Should be a keeper, but probably only worth it for people that plan to play quite a bit.  I've only played Spirecrest twice and while adding a few interesting things to focus on, I'm not sure it's actually making the game better.  Although, it doesn't appear to be making it worse.  Needs more plays before I make a decision on keeping it.  It may end up being a nice to have (like Bellfaire), but not a requirement unless the game is played a lot - for variety's sake.",199792
3908,MAJBrown22,9,"Excellent worker placement and city builder coupled with beautiful art and presentation. The card combos build in complexity as the game progresses, beginning with short simple turns and finishing with combos upon combos. This wonderful combination of theme and mechanics make for a game that's easy to learn yet strategically deep.",199792
3909,MajorPsycho,8,"Everdell is a breath of fresh air. The art is delightful, the meeples very cute and the Evertree impressive ! Before anything else, before the game starts, you just dive into an atmosphere of calm, ready to take a relaxing walk in this sunny green meadow :)  The game then starts, and you are tasked to gather up to 15 buildings and critters in the best way possible. You have workers who get you ressources so that you can play your cards, which often give you ressources as well. It can be compared to Wingspan, without the ""there is only one spot for that ressource"" aspect. The way to win is to create combos, to summon critters for free because you already have their building, to get the Wife with the Husband, to have several farms before you play the Toad, to get that Shopkeeper as early as possible to get tons of free berries, etc. But most of that, you can't decide that you will do it. You depend heavily on when the cards are drawn from the deck (if ever, you generally don't exhaust the deck), and of course, a strong combo played at the beginning is a huge advanatege. So you have to adapt, do the best you can with what you have. So sometimes everything will go smoothly, you will chain combo over combo, and sometimes you will struggle hard to get two stones to build that building. A little bit like Wingspan though. Being that luck depend makes it less prone to tryharding, which best fits the theme. I wouldn't like to fight and overthink optimisation in that atmosphere. I enjoy it as it is, relaxing, you just walk, you seize the moment, do what you can with what's available, and then come what may. Don't be mistaken, taking any card randomly will lead you nowhere. Of course the one able to adapt quickly and to make the best of the available cards will probably win. It's an interesting challenge. I do recommand it. But we are closer of a family game (in a family of regular players) than a Wargame ! Also, the limit of 15 cards in your town prevent a player who has lots of ressources/strong combos/... to keep playing forever and crush everyone in the end. You have to choose what cards to play, you can't discard freely old cards you played for ressources, so you have to choose wisely if you want that ressource on the card, or keep the spot free for a strong late game card which will be worth tons of points.  So, for most people, I'd recommand it !",199792

3963,marcuslind1,3,"2024-05-03 Rating after first play, 4p: 3/10. Cute critters in solitaire town.  Bad: Too much luck of the draw, too much hard to read card text, and too little direct or interesting player interaction. The only attack card I saw in play (The Fool) seemed too strong, and cards that let you use other players' cards are cumbersome because of how hard it is to read other players' tableaus. Comboing can make turns long and forces heads down play to execute well. Long game. If you finish early you must wait for other (probably better) players to finish before the game ends, which can mean several rounds of play. Good: Tight starting economy. Limited number of cards in hand and in your tableau adds an interesting restriction that you have to plan around (again, The Fool can really mess up a player's game). Artwork and bits are nice. Pulling of combos can be fun. The open market mitigates some of the luck dependence. Verdict: Le Havre and Agricola are still the best worker placement games of this kind to me, when it comes to building your personal board or tableau. Everdell has some nice things going for it, but ultimately feels to bloated and solitaire to compete. But if you want a combination of classic worker placement and personal tableau building with some twists, crazy components and generally non-aggressive play, Everdell is worth checking out.",199792

3997,marnibarni,10,"Everdell is such a nostalgic game for me now, since it was my gateway game into the board game universe that has taken over my life. This game is 10/10 for all things theme, replayability, worker placement mechanics, balancing and general feel-good fun. The worker placement pacing in Everdell is second to none, as it progresses so seamlessly with your own engine (city).   Though the game has limits (e.g. 15 cards in your city and only so many workers), there are so many fun combos you find when playing that help prolong your game and turn you into a victory point gremlin, sucking every last drop (but in a wholesome way...)! Couldn't recommend this game enough for those needing the push they need into the wonderful world of gaming!",199792

The player rounds are very tight and you need to know what you're doing to score more. Not a gateway game at all. Every worker is precious thing and should not be wasted, because winter is coming very quickly in this game. It looks that in two player game, you will not get all the cards you want and this can be considered as negative thing by some, however I'm alright with do what you can with what you got attitude.

As an engine builder, it suffers from the first two rounds being too weak and the last two rounds being too powerful. I would have preferred to start the game with all my workers and lose one each round (kind of like how Wingspan does it). The several expansions are nice, but playing with more than one at a time is not recommended. I think that the base game and a couple aspects of the expansions would be perfect.",199792

4044,Mattias Persson,6,"Played 5-10 times since 2019. I have mixed feelings about this one. Most disturbing is the luck of the draw. The game strongly encourages you to aim for card combos, and then buries the two cards you need in a 100-card deck. The special events really emphasise the luck element. Usually, this kind of goals help players formulate a strategy. Here, they make you wait the entire game for a card that never shows up. For such a lucky game, it´s not very short either. On the plus side, you have important decisions every turn. The solo variant gives you slightly more control and might be my favourite way to play the game. Perhaps a 7 solo, a 6 at two and a 5 with three.",199792

4055,Matzo_Man,9.3,"Асиметричність: В залежності від черговості ходу, кожен гравець бере певну кількість карт. Являється, у своєму роді, елементом утримання балансу на початку гри, щоб перший гравець, у якого менше карт, зміг виставити свого робочого на най приваблюючу для нього поляну, але не мав більшої різноманітності карт у себе на руці. Проте, це не завжди являється гарантом того, що всі гравці будуть починати гру за однакових умов, в залежності від того, які карти попадуться кожному. Тривалість партії: Біля однієї години – помірний час для 1-2 партій гри, щоб зіграти, наприклад, після роботи у сімейному колі. Цікава гра на достатній проміжок часу, щоб не занудьгувати та, при цьому, гарно провести час. Казуальність: Прості правила, оптимальна час гри, цікава механіка виставляння робочих робить цю гру простою для розуміння і освоєння. Проте, при більшій кількості гравців, гра буде набирати складність, а ще – відчувається різниця між досвідченими гравцями і новачками (не критично). Також гравці будуть вимушені ретельно вибирати карти, які придбати, розіграти і т.п. Для кого? Для тих, кому подобається євро-ігри, а саме євро школи – один з, я вважаю, представників саме цієї школи (хоча я і сумнівався, до якої саме школи ця гра відноситься).

4056,maumastoks,8,"An introductory game into heavy board games - Everdell isn't complicated nor it is particularly heavy but has all the introductory mechanics into heavy-side euro board games. It is very thematic but at the same time is an eurogame with engine building, hand management mechanics. It could be summarized as a mixture between Wingspan and Brass. It is not e very easy game, but not a difficult one either. Perfect for relaxing eurogaming evenings with truly nicely illustrated components. Very replayable and once you've grinded this game enough, grab one of the expansions! Has a solo mode with automa cards if you're into that, but this game is mostly for 3 players: 2 won't be as exciting but still viable nonetheless whilst with 4 it might get quite aggressive and competitive as taking cards/objectives you need might be harder. Also more player = more wait time, as this game has quite a downside if some players do they turn and then start relaxing - you have to constantly plan, calculate and follow what's going on in the game. Sandboxing will leave you to a loss and frustration from other players if you're starting to think only once it is your turn.",199792

However, this just means that rather than have a player skip a play or two waiting for the end of the round, these passes happen all together at the end of the game, and a player can be waiting for 10-20 minutes for others to catch up. Typical min/maxing play, and draw luck/convenient timing can play a large part in determining the winner. Way too long for the gameplay - over 2 hours.  Fancy/cutesy components mostly detract from the gameplay, and should be left in the box.

The main things this game has going for it is that combos can make some cards free, and the lovely woodland creatures setting.

You're not sure if what you're building is going to work but as the meadow turns over and cards are drawn about you start seeing and hoping you'll get to do what you want to do... But then in the final season everything comes together and your motley crew of critters and constructions weave magic for your final score.   I've had requests to bring this to every travel game night with many people hungry to play again despite having never won.  Lastly, some of the combos between buildings and critters can be epic.

4154,Mezike,N/A,"I like it well enough, it feels a lot like a Trewicek-style tableau builder where you operate on what seems to be impossibly tight resources but if you have your wits about you then you can chain cards together to leverage their abilities and extend your turn out much longer than seems likely at first glance. What I really like about Everdell is that the fixed tableau size and individually-timed rounds restricts players from running away with the game. Timing becomes crucial as not having workers on hand means that you cannot jump into vacated spaces when someone changes their season, which inevitably means that you miss out on some of the plum ones altogether. Having a late and long Summer means that the other players get into the best scoring spaces while you are still locked out from them and they also have more workers available for grabbing the bonus-scoring events at a time when you are still using yours to scratch and dig for resources.  As you will eventually run out of space in your city there is no incentive to stay in any given season for too long other than to maximise the bonus that you earn in Spring and Autumn, which makes for very tough and interesting decisions on when to make your move. So although the other guys were astonished at how long I was able to drag out my seasons it was hugely problematic for me to do so and I had to keep cutting my plays shorter than they could have been in order to remain competitive with workers. I like that very much about this game.  What I don’t like so much though is the long list of “this must have been a kickstarter then” problems. The teeny tiny card text, the stupid badly designed tree, the easily-missed poor choice of differentiating between single-use and repeatable action spaces, the barely perceptible ‘open’ action symbols, the suspiciously imbalanced cards that you can drop into your tableau for free if they fall into your hands in just the right order. Oh it’s so close to being great, but there is no way I would reach over 51st State to play this and there is always Root to turn to for cutesy anthropomorphic critters in a complex game. I do hope there is a revised edition of this one day.",199792
4155,mfaller,9,"I like Everdell, really like it.  I had the retail version and I can't decide if its a great game or just a fairly average game but with a nice theme and some really nice artwork. As a designer I'm firmly in the camp that demands great design, theme and production values as well as great mechanics. But even I think this might be just style over substance.  I need more plays.  I kickstarted the recent collectors edition plus all the expansions - have to say it was probably the most expensive thing I've ever kickstarted and given that there isn;t really that much in each expansion - it feels incredibly overpriced.  I might edit this review once I actually receive my KS pledge (its 2 months late) and give it all a few more plays.",199792
4156,mfmise,5,Very nice production but there are some issues with game play. Smart players will drag on the game as the cards create combos that drag out turns endlessly. There is no way humanly possible that a game could end in 40 minutes. The end game scoring bonuses are also extremely arbitrary and random - not something you can credibly plan for.,199792

4273,mlehr,9,"Update 12/12/2022 We just set up the Spirecrest expansion for the first time, and let me tell you, those big critters are amazing.  I would go so far as to say your life isn't complete until you see them roaming around on your Everdell board.  Those big critters are so fun to ride around. The Spirecrest expansion increases Everdell to a 9.5.  It Fixes the two frustrations I had with the base game: Slow card cycling at two players and lack of interesting end game choices when you fill your city up.  Original comments:  Everdell is a mash up of game mechanics from existing games like Lords of Waterdeep and 7 Wonders (I like it better than both because it's the good kind of mashy), but most importantly it is fun to play.  The presentation is where it really shines.  If your kid (or you) likes the theme of woodland critters, they will love the game (unless they are like my kid and stopped playing boardgames except if it's my birthday or Father's Day).    Update:  The app is delightful and maintains all the charm of the physical version.  A game that I like way more than I think I should.    Update 2:  This plays well solo*. Simple rules for managing Rugworts that don't get in the way of the game but add some fun tension.    Rugworts makes you focus more on events than you might otherwise.  I am very interested to see how good the solo experience is in the Mistwood expansion.  I also plan to try out fan created solo-mode Everdell Unrigged while I wait for Mistwood.  *I play it solo on the tabletop instead of the app as I like looking at the game on my table and moving around all of the charming cards and pieces.

But the 1 play makes me wonder if the at least some portion of the randomness can be overcome to some extent with skill. The season progress challenge is pretty interesting as well. Probably a game that will be significantly better if playing with a group that plays it often. Still rates lower than Terraforming Mars at the end of the day I suppose (as an engine builder); and I do not really like TFM.  11/6/19 Feedback remains the same. The expansions do make the game a bit more interesting I suppose. But yea.. a lot depends on the card draw and player order. Player order issue gets masked by the card draw issue, but I feel that the lower number of cards to start with is not really a sufficient handicap. The card art does look absolutely spectacular though. And the board is not terrible either. And the box looks pretty good too. Overall, the production quality is noticeably better than TFM, but this game actually makes TFM look better because I already get so annoyed with the card draw randomness in that game (despite the drafting, which is not even an option here - replaced by the meadows which I do not think are a sufficiently good alternative).  12/29/19 -1 cause I prefer TFM with expansions over Everdell with expansions.",199792

4326,MormonVoodoo,6.8,"I like the blend of tableau-building with worker placement in this game. I could see myself playing this again, but maybe not competitively. The downside of this game for me is the RNG. In other tableau-building games I play, the RNG of the card unbalance is leveled out through a draft (or something similar). In Everdell, many of your cards are being drawn blind from a central pile, and the cards you draw can affect your success way too much for my liking. But to be fair, that's the only drawback for me that was gameplay related. It's a big one, but I liked everything else.   Outside of gameplay, another drawback that I notice (that I didn't have to deal with) is the huge price. While the gameplay only requires some meeples and cards, a buyer is essentially paying for the component quality, which include a massive 3D tree and high-quality resource tokens. This is a plus for a lot of people who WANT to spend extra on component upgrades. But I'd rather pay for the game mechanics at 30 bucks instead of 70+.",199792

4331,morteigan,9.5,"Everdell est un super bon engine building, worker placement et de gestion de ressources.  Ton but est vraiment de monter une ville, monter des combos et de rentabilisé tes investissement.  Bien que d'apparence mignone, le jeu est assez sans pitié et c'est vraiment une guerre pour avoir ce qu'on a besoin pour arriver à la ville la plus prolifique.  Le jeu est carrément superbe, d'une production incroyable.  Le jeu aurait 9 comme note si ce n'était de 2 défauts qui a mon avis font qu'il perd quelque plumes.  Premier défaut, le hazard de la pige peut détruite ton jeu.  Si tu part avec aucun combo, si le meadow n'a aucun combos et que tu n'arrive pas à partir un engin dans les 2 premières saisons sinon tu va savoir que tu as perdu.  Au moins des combos y'en a plein, mais ça reste un défaut qui a gaché une de mes games.  Deuxième défaut, Engine Building et Worker Placement peut créer de grandes frustration.  Il te manque 1 ressource pour arriver à tes fins et un joueur prend ton spot qui peut détruire une saison de planification.  Bon, ça peut être un problème de gestion aussi, mais ça reste que le fait de bloquer les joueurs dans ce type de jeu peut en rebutter plusieurs.  Finalement, le jeu comporte une stratégie centrale, bâtir ta ville.  Tu peux pas faire d'autres stratégie, ce qui est correcte car c'est le thème.  Par contre, si tu te fait bloquer et si que tu est pas chanceux sur la pige, tu risque d'avoir une partie amer.  Sinon vraiment un jeu spécial et qui a une belle place dans ma collection.

Long playtime with 4.  [b]:meeple: Recommended # of players:[/b] Probably it's best at 3. At 4 is still a nice experience but there might be a little downtime.  [b]:!block: Remarks:[/b] It's a gorgeous game staring at the components and artwork. I will not lie to you: this is a dry worker placement game; yet it finds its way to be thematic. The big tree, while completely useless from a gameplay perspective, manages to let you feel being into a magical forest with all its fascinating inhabitants. Most of the cards are paired one another (construction-animal) in a logical-cultural way, and strive to be thematic in their mechanics as well. There is also a tableau building part which sees you building your city: those cards mentioned earlier will shape your strategy into a small living world that tells a story. About cards interaction i can say there is plentiful and all those triggers beautifully interlocks, giving me a ""magic the gathering"" like vibe at times. Everdell is currently listed as a family game: by no means this is a family game. There is a lot of stuff going on here and i don't think it might be good for casual plays. Other than the theme, which looks friendly and cute, there is nothing else about Everdell which falls into the family category.   Some minor complaints:  During the autumn season there can be very little to do, you might already have almost filled your city, leaving you cycling cards to get the expensive ones.  Some event cards are too specific into requiring you to acquire a precise couple of cards to fulfill them.  This game is a multiplayer solitaire, which usually i highly dislike, but theme and cards comboing off helped immensely. There is only one card which can interact with an opponent city and i find it out of place in a game like this one. I would leave it out.",199792

4425,Murraculous,5.5,"Everdell is mechanically and thematically neat.  It has a table presence that will knock your socks off and killer artwork to boot.  The combination of cute woodland creatures and forest resources with tableau building and worker placement give it an authentic charm and appeal.  We played this right after a round of Wingspan, and for better or worse, Everdell is much like Wingspan in more ways than one.  The irony of Everdell is that this larger than life production requires more leaning, squinting, craning, and skimming than any game I’ve ever played in my life.  Perhaps for a 1 or 2 player session, this isn’t as much of a complaint, but even then this game is a constant strain to play.  The card text is unquestionably too small and too abundant for a tableau builder with a large market resulting in a mess of cards across the table.  This fact alone eliminates any possibility of Everdell having any kind of tableau player interaction.  Players have no clue what’s going on with anyone else’s woodland “city.“  The most the game can strive for is a race to collect sets of card symbols for a few minor bonus points.  This low-interaction tableau building shouldn’t be much of an issue when the game also has a full-fledged worker placement system,  yet somehow that feature provides minimal interaction as well.    In our 4 player game, there was NEVER a moment where somebody disrupted my plans by claiming a space.  I was always off doing something entirely different or able to find an alternate solution to get what I wanted.  The legs of tension were thus cut out from under this worker placement mechanism.  But does this game really NEED tension?  Does it NEED player interaction?  Does it NEED to have an improved font and readability?  Perhaps not... after all, it is a game about being small, mind-your-own-business woodland creatures who are simply preparing for winter.  Of course, when one player’s winter arrives 25 minutes before the game ends, that can make for a long hibernation.",199792

4438,mycophagous,6,"Really enjoyable tableau builder with over the top production. Love having it as a table-piece and interacting with the lovely artwork and components. The game behind it has some solid decision-making but often felt a little apparent at times. The beautiful setting and production, however, definitely earn this an extra point for my personal rating. (May 2020)  -----  Sold this on due to the amount of text on all the cards. In a fairly light-weight and simple engine-building game Players need to read them all in order to play their own game competently and anticipate any of their opponent's actions. This artificially slows down the game far too much for what I had initially planned to  be a quick, light-hearted filler. Furthermore, the over-the-top production looks fantastic but is completely obstructive to the gameplay - the tree, in particular, completely obscures at least one player's view of the cards and table in 3+ player games. The gameplay is fine, and without these hinderances I would have loved to keep it, but it just ended up gathering dust before trading on to free up space for a filler more suited to my own shelves.

Don’t know why I hated it so much. It’s not (yet) spectacular but it’s good enough for a fun light game.  Don't see what all the fuss is: people gushing over this.  It's fun-ish and the components are lovely, and its all very pretty but I'm still not convinced about the gameplay. Game is an inexcusable table hog. Just awful. Expansions make it Worse.  So after all this, it’s good. Not great. Not this fantastic game everyone paradesa round saying. But it’s sure a good looking game and I appreciate that.

4441,mylesgrxnt,7,"Everdell is worker placement and tableau building done right. The game is approachable, yet deep. It's beautiful, but the beauty doesn't detract from the gameplay. Everdell, at its core, is a point salad tableau building game, where everyone drafts cards using worker placement spots to gain resources. This works excellently, and its simplicity means that everyone you teach this game will be able to instantly pick it up and play and have a great time. This game is a staple in my collection, and the go-to whenever I think of worker placement games. The only downside I have is a little bit of balancing issues with some of the cards, as I have found there are certain cards combos that are just objectively better than every other card combos, despite what strategy you are going for, so it comes down to you not being able to win without those card combos. This is, unfortunately, a stain on an otherwise incredible game.  Edit: Was an 8, now a 7. Don't get this to the table enough to warrant the higher score and there have been other games that replaced Everdell in terms of medium weight euros.

4480,Nalex222,6,"This is a beautifully designed engine-building game where the art truly carries the experience. Turns start out quickly, but the end game stalls as every player tries to maximize their remaining actions for points. This is why I prefer playing it with 2 players rather than 3 or 4.  My main gripe is that you never quite feel like you’ve built a powerful, point-generating engine. There aren’t enough cards that combo well together, which can be especially frustrating when the card you need never appears. This lack of synergy means the game doesn’t offer the same satisfying feeling of engine-building seen in games like Seasons, Race for the Galaxy, or even The Bloody Inn, where your tableau comes to life.  Despite these shortcomings, the game still provides a relatively enjoyable, albeit “heads down,” playing experience. The fantastic art and simple mechanics, which mean you rarely need to consult the rulebook, are likely why it’s so popular.

4523,neflight86,5,"Pretty, but clearly expansion bait. Limited turn worker placement resource gathering with recipe fulfillment via cards and very light engine building. Basic elements work well enough, but oddly, players can get windfalls of critter cards that simply play for free if the appropriate building has already been built, meaning that players gain random ""free builds"" of valuable critters by card draw. While this did not appear to break the game in any player's favor, it is a curious source of swing in efficiency, and a kick to the gut when a building for a critter you have already paid to play is revealed in the central board or your hand. Hoping the experience will improve with the multiple expansions, as the theme, artwork and game play are good gateway material.  Update: Sadly, expansions did little to change my core problem with this game: a great majority of the arbitrary complexity of the game lies not in its turn structure, which is mercifully easy to explain, but in parsing a sea of options and information. Much of that information is on cards that every player will want to read/understand, but are simply too many available at a given time to remember them all (hand plus meadow), meaning re-reading and more downtime. The expansions only introduce more decision space complexity for some arguable depth. Also, there is a weird lack of tension in our plays with there feeling like too many open worker placement spaces, leading to fewer difficult opportunity cost decisions. Pretty production, but ultimately, just not worth the time to play due to the constant evaluating of card effects, and not fun enough to invest the multiple plays to reach a level of familiarity - reach the intended game experience.",199792

Your first game will be spent reading at cards, learning them, trying to remember them, stumbling around... Everdell is way too hard on a novice to be a family game. It doesn't give you a direction. You need to find it yourself. (There are pleasant synergies to be found and some engine building to be done.) Loads of text in tiny print also makes the game non-valid for non-English speaking people, and for people with middle-aged+ eyes. But if your family is made of English-speaking, under 40 y. old hobby gamers with teenage daughters who are still into cute animals, and you are determined to play the game repeatedly, Everdell is a good choice.",199792

The fact that certain cards don't show up in the big card deck is not a problem. Got the Mistwood expansion because of the solo mode for me. After that, we got the big box collection.

4615,nodnarber1,8,"Good game but it takes a few plays to get great. You need to know the card combos otherwise it's a little stressful trying to figure out what to do.  1-24-20 - This game has always been a ""good"" game but not really ""great"" to me.  I bought it mostly because of the hype.  After my 4th play and 1st w/ 4 players, this went up a few notches for me.  I think it's a very good game now, about 8/10.  It's brain-burny at first because you have to really look for opportunities, learn the cards and how they relate to each other and find ways to cleverly get tight resources.  The 1st play can be grueling.  Once you really learn the cards and locations then it really starts to shine.  Then you can start to put together some solid strategies.    things I like: -tight resource economy (""How do I get those frickin' pebbles???!"") -clever thinking is feels very rewarding.  Thinking a few steps ahead - the better you play the more fun the game is.    Keeping till I get the big box in 2022 ---------------  old thoughts:  This game is gorgeous.  I played a solo game and had a pretty good time, though I feel like I need a few more plays to really understand the game.  It plays kind of like Race for the Galaxy where you are building a tableau and you can discard cards to take certain actions at times, but with worker placement.  The worker placement is mostly for getting resources as far as i can tell, it's the card-playing that matters.    If I had to choose between this and Wingspan, I would choose this.  Wingspan, though beautiful, has less interesting decisions to make in my opinion.  Everdell also has a lot of really cool looking expansions whereas Wingspan just has more birds.    Really glad I have this in my collection.  Might be one of the harder games for my casual group to grasp.  math traded november 2021",199792

4678,odie73,7,"I have come to the realization that tableau builders are not really my thing. They usually lack meaningful interaction and require an amount of bookkeeping and tracking one's card effects that for me distract from the actual game. Add to that an occasionally severe luck factor when cards are drawn more or less randomly.   These points are less of an issue in Everdell. There is more interaction than usual due to the worker placement aspect, the common card pool to draft from, and the race for the victory point objectives. The limited size of the tableau also reduces the bookkeeping during the game. Cards are present in multiples which reduces the luck factor.   Besides those plusses, Everdell convinces with an absolute wonderful presentation. Cute art, animal meeples, special resources, all give it a wonderful table presence. The tree is kind of superfluous, though, and we usually skip setting it up. The playtime of about 30 minutes per player also seems right. Maybe a small knock is that one player can finish the game quite a bit earlier than the others and then has to wait but that has not really been a major issue in any of our games.     Overall, Everdell is among my most liked tableau/engine builders and I am usually up for a play although most of the time I will likely not suggest it.   ",199792

I am always amazed by how well the seasons work out. It seems you have nothing to work with when starting out, and then by the end of the game it ticks over nicely, berries roll in and your squirrel is running around happily.  Can be a bit confusing to start with. I suggest you play a couple of seasons with open hand, or watch the GameNight! playthrough. Then you can really start exploring strategies and aim for that perfect year that is so elusive.",199792
4695,OisinJosVoisin,7,Solid game with great art and components. I really dislike the goal cards. They are super specific and the text is small so I often find myself picking them up again and again because I forgot what was the specific card combination needed to achieve them.

Makes me want to buy it to introduce to non-gamer friends, but it might be just a little bit too complex to be a perfect gateway game. And a bit too basic for hardcore crowd.

The rubber Berries are difficult to grab as they grip other surfaces too effectively and bounce all over the place when dropped from any height. The cylindrical Twigs roll with the slightest gust.

Es espectacular la sensación de progresión a medida que pasas de temporada. Tanto, que la primera vez que jugamos mi mujer y yo abandonamos al comenzar la segunda temporada, porque creimos que estábamos jugando mal, al apenas poder hacer mucha cosa. Tuvimos que ver videos y estudiar mejor el juego para entender que es normal, y que a medida que vas pasando de temporada, los trabajadores dejan de ser tan fundamentales, si consigues entender la mecánica de combos de las cartas. Sin embargo, mi valoración tras más de 5 partidas no puede subir más allá de 8, ya que la rejugabilidad, más allá de esas primeras 5, no es muy alta, porque el azar no supone demasiada variabilidad en la mecánica, llegando a ser ya un poco monótona.",199792

I feel the game is not accessible enough, relative to the calm and cutesy theme it presents.  A strong start in the game can give a player a significant advantage, as there are limited ways to catch up or hinder others' progress.   The game's tree component wasn't problematic on a big table.  Distinguishing between Critters/Constructions and Commons/Uniques was challenging at a glance, which increased the game's complexity.

4767,Overexposed,8,"The card play feels a bit like a combination of parts of Seasons and 7 Wonders, and then there are basic worker placement mechanics thrown in. It all works very well. None of the mechanics are new, but it's a very strong combination of them presented here. The ability to jump into the next ""season"" without other players is also an interesting idea, but there is no way to force the game end at all, so I don't think there is ever any reason not to stretch out your moves as long as possible.  The artwork is of course glorious and super-cute throughout. I actually had minor issues with a couple of the icons used, though.  On the downside, personally, I find the number of text-based cards that you have to face all at once (18 or so possible playable ones, on top of all the card powers in your tableau) a bit too daunting - I have to continually re-read them all throughout the game. And the text could have been larger.",199792

4775,OzzyTGAP,10,"At first I didn't like this game that much. It was impossible to understand which card will get you where. Actually it still feels like that, but I really like the card combos. It's very based on luck which card you get at the beginning of the game and later in the game as well. It's impossible to foresee which of the event cards will appear, so you cannot be sure which way to follow exactly. Therefore, at the beginning of all the games I played, I felt so desperate and it was really hard to select which cards to play first.   And also texts are pain to read. There are lots of cards to read in this game until learning all of them. That might turn many people off, glad it didn't for me.",199792
4776,p00q,4,"Very modern euro-aesthetic design. Animal themed art, high production value, low interaction, meaningless point salad elements.  The board state for other players is just completely unreadable, the worker placement is very uninspired, and the point salad is so over-balanced it is meaningless. I'm assuming every game ends with all players around 51 points by default, and it is whomever manages to eek out the few extra to get to 60 wins.

4819,paprik,5,"It's okay, but has a few significant downsides. - We found it to be rather heavy on randomness. - It relies on card combos and the most powerful cards have only a few copies which you might not see so it feels like you can really plan anything. - Most of your ""skill"" will be about knowing all the cards and possible combos, therefore even slightly experienced players have a huge advantage over beginners. - Long for what it is, with 4+ players. - Takes a lot of space.",199792

Maybe because a big part (and my favourite) of the game is about engine building with cards in front of you/hand management. There's nothing not to like really, plays well with gamers and non-gamers alike. Rules/gameplay is very clean, but offers you many choices if that is what you are looking for.  ",199792

The game in and of itself is not overtly complex, but offers an immense amount of variety to the point that each game will be drastically different.  Strategies will be built on the fly.  You will posture against your opponents to force them into the next season to free up that one location you need to place your character on.

The games tend to feel very similar and play out a lot like every other. My preferred way to play Everdell is with Spirecrest and some bits from Bellfaire. The two sideboards (left + right) look like 100% bloat to me, although the train's cute.  I am looking forward to rolling some Mistwood solo into the mix, but I've got a lot of Everdell content, and it becomes more of a pain to set it up and may be a bit too laborious for solo.

Play cards either from their hand or a common pool, or use their workers to activate board spaces or buildings. One a player runs out of workers, he can get them back and get more workers, but once he does that so many times his game is over—and everyone else gets to finish their games. The cards combo well both in terms of reducing costs and their special abilities. As a medium-weight game, I thought this played well, and gave players plenty to think about. My one complaint is visibility issues—it was often difficult (but important) to read what cards that weren’t in front of you said.  (2 plays)",199792

Nothing really stood out for me though and I'm not sure there is much in the way of variance in game to game. It's overproduced without much actual content to be had. I don't understand the high rating for this. Maybe an expansion or two fixes this by making it less tedious, but eh...

If you are drawn to games because of the deeply integrated theme, beautiful art, high component quality, AND you like games that ask you to adapt and be quick on your toes, then you will ALWAYS find an excuse to get this to the table.   If, however, you are a deeply strategic euro gamer at heart, and only really enjoy games that you can control and execute your strategy without interruption (ie-  dislike random card draws, etc) then you’ll find this game fun but frustrating.   I’m firmly in the first category, so this game hits on all cylinders for me. But I can understand why some folks would find it just doesn’t allow them to play the way they want to.   Edit: 9-19-19.

4993,pmartin89,9,"Love this game. Fun little engine builder with some of the most gorgeous art I've ever seen in a board game. It's a ton of fun but the ability to engine built effectively can sometimes be impacted by the size of the deck.   When you get the cards you need to trigger or build other cards, you engine sings and it's a dream. But you could just as easily put out a bunch of critters and then not see the construction cards that pair with them until the end of the game and it's too late. Having your engine be at the mercy of card draw can sometimes make you feel a bit helpless.  I also really wished the city your building and your player space had a bit more substance to it. I was excited to hear that Bellfaire added ""player mats"" to the game... but the're not player mats. They're L-shaped boards with pretty designs on them. Give me a place to store my resources and workers. Considering how much detail is put into the board, it would be cool to have that for a really detailed player board and city mat that you build out during the game.  Another issue I have is the incorporation of expansions into the game. Going back to the size of the deck, it's difficult to incorporate multiple expansions together as it further dilutes the massive deck making it harder to potentially get any sort of synergy between your cards.  A wonderful game that I would gladly make a 10 if it weren't for the above, minor, issues I have with the game.",199792

It's kind of ironic that I gave away my original copy to my cousin because I was planning to buy the complete edition (which I still hasn't as of now because of how expensive it is) and ending up trying to buy a copy, which is much more expensive now!  My memory of playing it for the first time still remains, hence, why to give justice to this very simple, comforting fantasy board game, I'm planning to buy the complete edition.  As how ProZD puts it, the game is very chill and easy to follow. Though it holds a 2.8 something of a difficulty scale, which I equate to how something close to Hansa Teutonica, a game that I kind of fairly got after few reads through its rulebook and with the help of Nithrania's excellent tutorial video.  To this day, every time I wanted to play a game that is something cutesy but with breadth and depth, I resort to Everdell. This is my very first worker placement introduction, incorporated by hand management mechanics and a bit of engine building? Not really but there are ""Cities"" and ""Critters"" you build. There are also load of end gaming elements that you'll need to prepare and watch out if you are for the winning objective.  The game also did not shy away from components.

The 3D tree where you track seasons, keep your pawns and bonuses, is totally useless. It could simply be an extended part of the flat board. It's just there for show.  The theme could just as easily been Dante's Seven Levels of Hell, or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which isn't a good thing, because all it shows is that the mechanics were done first, the theme at the very end during some marketing meeting.   There's too much to keep in mind. There are 4 materials you can use to build stuff, because, ""hey, other games have 3, so we will have 4!"" The instructions on some cards you play are so bloated, it forces the more normal players to simply avoid using them. Each card you draw has over a dozen elements on them, and many have interwoven effects on one another, so using the cards require quite a bit of memory. ""Did I use that card? Can I use it again? What can I use it with? Will it affect the final score? Can others use my card?""   On the positive side, you have to carefully choose which card you play because others can take advantage of them, the art is great, the 3D tree looks awesome on Instagram, but once you really think about it, man, what a let-down.

5085,PvtBeckMorale1,8,"Birthday present 2019. Played for the first time Dec 2019, 2 players. Really enjoyed this game. Played twice, lost both times.  True to form, our plays took much longer than the time on the box. Thankfully, there aren’t many rules and most of the references to the rule book were for the explanations of the individual cards; indeed, I purposely referred to it whenever we saw a card for the first time just for clarification at the first opportunity.  Very much in line with many views already aired on BGG, I think the game is a visual treat. The appealing anthropomorphic character art was certainly the factor that most attracted me to the game in the first place. The board (including the Evertree which was no problem in a 2-player game, but would have to be removed with more players), resources and worker pieces are also pleasing on the eye.   The ‘meat’ of the game is the Critter and Construction cards. These contain a fair amount of information, some of it not very easy to read (‘open’ signs, I’m thinking of you), but familiarity soon overcomes that. The combinations of the cards are the key to success and it’s not long before the players are faced with the classic agonies of having too many things they want to do with their next action, or being one resource short of a killer play.  Overall, we enjoyed the game immensely and I subsequently played a 4-player game with different players, again well received. Still to win!",199792

Cons: Only real con I have is the whole layout of the board and tree. It's kind of a pain having to reach over the table to get stuff, and that was only with two players. The endgame bonus cards that are supposed to go into the second layer of the tree had to come down. There's no way people will be able to see/reference them otherwise.

The special locations and cards in the meadow add a lot of replayability, but also make the game feel very random.  The art is very cute and enjoyable to look at.  The most fun I've had playing was with the faction abilities introduced in the Bellfaire expansion.  I felt as if those abilities gave me a sense of direction while playing.   I find it plays best at 2 as adding more players just slows the game down. (I've played at 2, 3, and 6 as of this writing). The meadow and shared locations are often competed for, but that is the only real player interaction (outside of the few cards that allow a player to ""visit"" another tableau"".

5124,RabbitFly,8,"This game is quite subverting. The art being so ""kid friendly"" some might even call them childish is one thing. As the game is quite complicated to get a grasp on.   However the way I find it the most subverting is actually how incredibly tight this game is despite it not being instantly obvious. Honestly I have found that the more games I play with this, the more complicated the puzzle becomes.   This is a double edged sword for sure, because it is entirely possible to become locked into analysis paralysis from turn 1. But it is also what I find very interesting about the game. There is room for tuning your efficiency every turn, and because of how end game kind of creeps up on you, decisions will often have bigger consequences than one might assume.   The table presence is amazing, but this is also a double edged sword as it is a table hog on another level, especially when played with multiple expansions. Even if you just play it as a 2 player game.   Overall I find Everdell a very tight and interesting puzzle with quite a lot of variety, and I love the presentation, but it also makes a bit harder to get to the table.",199792

5126,RabiTampa,10,"Edited grammatical errors:  This is only about the retail version of the base game.  The theme and production quality of this game is incredible and is an attraction on its own. From the Ever Tree, to the pleasant color palette and the art on the cards, this game just welcomes players.  The game itself is very solid. continuing with the theme of the game. From the players' perspective, you start out, what feels, very restricted. You have a fist full of card and a meadow filled with options, but you only have two workers. you can play a card (hopefully a production card like a farm or resin refinery) and prepare for the next season (Spring). now your production card generates a resource and you get an additional worker.  This progression develops over the game and by summer and autumn, you have so many options (card options, abundance of workers for resource gathering and locations that allow critters to be played for free) and your city becomes a place you feel you've built.  The player interaction is has been brought up quite a lot as there is only one negative effect that can be done to interrupt another player's city, and that is the fool. All other interactions have a more positive take on interaction. Such as the Post Office (Give a player two cards from your hand and discard card. than draw up to you hand limit). This can be seen as a negative for some people, as the negative interactions are really common in the board gaming scene, but I think this is great. I can only think of Lords of Waterdeep that has a ""give you something good and I get something better"" type of interaction.  The basic events add character to the city you build if you can get them and add additional points to your end game total. There is one real issue with the game.  The Special Event are nice and seems to be a ""if you can get it"" part of the game. In game of 3-4 players, these events can come in handy to for getting the edge as your city will not be perfectly aligned. In two player games, these Special Events are truly an afterthought. In Solo, these cards become an artificial difficulty spike during year 2 and 3.  This game is amazing and is played so much with my group, the Ever Tree has not been disassembled for weeks.  What a fun and beautiful game. ",199792

There are confusing elements too, eg. the action spots that are available/not available for other players --> because of this, if you do not know the card, the game will be very long (way too long for what it can offer) - Poorly constructed rulebook (e.g. the ""detailed"" card clarifications answered none of our questions) - The artwork on the cards is beautiful and cute but this alone cannot save this game.",199792

No other game does this, and its engine/worker mechanics are so carefully honed keepy the game incredibly balanced, thematic, and oh-so frustrating (""ahhh, I need to just one more pebble"").

The components and theme are absolutely gorgeous, the tree is kind of ridiculous though.",199792
5169,Ranior,5,"I'll start with the positives. Everdall is visually stunning. The theme is fun and unique. There are a bunch of cool bits of some unique resources (berries!). Even the board isn't the standard rectangle or square and while the tree is a bit ridiculous it does add to the unique presentation.   The worker placement stuff is fairly interested with some nice variety. The twist of having players be at slightly different stages at some points resulting in players removing their workers back to their pool at different times creates some unique puzzles unlike the standard worker placement games of all players putting things out in a round and all retrieving at the same time.   The downside is I don't think the gameplay is all that good. For one, I'm just not a big fan of games that rely on players constantly evaluating card text. I find it slows things down and is just a bit boring compared to the Euros I consider truly great and brilliant that don't tend to require that. Essentially while it may offer up plenty of options and unique situations it really slows down the game of actually thinking about the best move when everyone is instead figuring out what can actually be done at all.   The even bigger issue though for me is that I feel the ways this tableau building is set up has the situation to be very unfair. Because some cards chain into others, there is a heavy dose of luck in getting those combinations assembled either via the deal or the central cards available to all. If you can start off early with a great combo (like a farm/store/shopkeeper) and get it into play during the first season suddenly you have a crazy engine and are far ahead of the other players. Since this is a game of economic snowballing like so many others, this early luck and position is hard to overcome. Even though the game does have a few mild ways to slow down a leader (the fool being one) the game often offers up options to counter that (the dungeon is the counter for the fool for example). Even then the player who gets that snowball rolling often can rush for the various objectives and secure those victory points over their opposition.   Add on top of this that main objectives also require players to get lucky into having the right building combinations to score, and it would seem that much of the game is going to be decided by card draw. I don't actually know this as I'd have to play a lot more to really be sure, and I will be curious to see what ""experts"" eventually find.  Overall I'll play Everdell as it does look very nice, the gameplay can be kind of interesting, and it goes by in a nice timeframe. I just think it's a rather poor game to really test who is the better player. ",199792

I like how players can be on different tempos, so workers can stay on spaces for a while, and then suddenly the good spots are open. Adding in workers each round is nice, rather than making you race to build them. And the tree is cool.  The problem is the game is not light or fast enough to match the cute theme, and not better than a dozen other worker placement/tableau games. The game is a beast to set up for a cute couple's game, and yet I still see people do it at breweries and cafes. The good cards have a lot of text on them, which makes for lots of reading. And the VP goals feel kind of forgettable, up in that tree.  If you have too many cards at the end, you can turn them in for points. Most of the engine-building in this game is marginal, like getting an extra berry or wood a few times. It feels like it's keeping scores close so there's no hard feelings, only pleasant smiles.

5216,realjw,4,"Great visuals, gameplay wise is quite meh to me.  Too much luck of the draw kind of situation. Cards are very wordy, very little symbology being used, such a chore to read all those stuff tbh. All those fiddly unnecessary bits like the freakin tree wtf dude.  Honestly, Manhattan Project: Energy Empire totally eclipsed this game, and doesn't have the problems I listed above. The game also has an arguably more interesting theme.  24 Apr 22 update: Yep still the problem. The cards you get dictates your maximum points. It's not that hard to try to abuse them when you have the chance to, it's harder to obtain them in the first place. Also the whole 7wonders thing where if you get building A, you can get B for free is another luck factor on top. It is NOT strategic at all when all you is mostly blindly draw from the deck.",199792

It plays quite well with two players. Four players can drag a bit if one player gets great card combinations and others don't (we had most reach the end, with one still left playing). But, even then, I enjoyed the game. The tree is cool, but I think I'll set it up sparingly (makes the event cards and spaces hard to see from all sides). I expect this game to get many plays.",199792

5241,Regnad Kcin,7,"Good, but a couple of nits to pick. The game is certainly eyecatching, with its tree and outstanding art on the meadow cards; however, I found myself needing to stand to examine the cards on the board, especially the special cards on the upper branches of the tree. No way could I read those casually while sitting in my seat. A super picky nit is that sleeved cards don't fit in their space in the Ever Tree. The game starts very slowly, but quickly builds as more cards get placed. Finding combos is the key to success. Finding combos is something I'm not particularly strong at, but I did manage to find a few and finish with a respectable 50 points. My group had fun playing Everdell, which gives it a little bump up, rating-wise. Update: Played a couple more times with different groups and enjoyed it both times.  My experience improved each time—familiarity definitely helps. Some games take time to grow on me (like Race for the Galaxy). Definitely a keeper. Score bump (sleeved)",199792

5244,rekath16,8,"I have a long story with Everdell. Fantasy is not my favourite theme and I was extremely bothered by the very small card texts. As the game starts with very many cards that all need to be read, discovered and understood, I frightened a big downtime potential.  I tried out Everdell's app to at least be able to talk about the game, but in my opinion is not the best board game implementation at all. Didn't like it.  Months later I showed the retail version in a book store to my wife and she asked me to give it a try. To make it short: She fell in love with Everdell's world and I like it too.  The most negative point about Everdell and all of the expansions is its rip-off price.  Next stop Pearl Brook.  *purchased 03.03.2024 (ebay); 37€",199792

I wanted to try a game like this, I did, I think it's fantastic and I sold it to make room for other games that fascinate me. Everdell has some easy rules, very, very easy. The heart of the game is in the cards and how you play them. There is some luck, of course, but it is the typical game that if you do not make the movements thinking, you will surely lose, no matter how bad your opponents are.

There are a decent amount of ways to cycle through cards, but I often found myself desperately looking for specific cards with no luck.  The luck factor coupled with the game's weight (which is lighter than I prefer my games) result in the low score. The game is probably quite decent in a casual setting.  ",199792

While building your woodland city, you race your opponents to achieve basic and special goals.  This race mechanism can get a little nasty if you swoop in a take an achievement someone was obviously working toward. Overall, I just love the mix of the mechanics and theme.  I really feel like I 'm making a city with its cast of characters.  As a solo game it is very satisfying.  Trying to undercut Rugwort at the right time is both challenging at times but so satisfying when it works out.

However, as much as I appreciate the general idea of Everdell, I am just not into its sweet theme and huge combos that are the core of the game.

Starts slow, with very few actions and hard to get resources, but then ramps way up where at the end you are scrambling to find how to use all your workers and resources to get points. Not a lot a player interaction - it lacks a lot of the space-blocking tension of most wp games. Rather the tension is more about opponents grabbing cards from the meadow you wanted, and beating you to special events. There’s some cards that make you pick an opponent to gift resources or cards. And there are a few take-that cards that feel out of place.

You are largely in control of your own tableau, but there is enough player interaction through worker placement (resources and event cards), meadow cards, and some card/resource passing effects that it doesn't feel like everyone is playing separately (and then the Fool card of course, but it's almost never worth playing IMO). A great balance of being in control of your own game but also feeling competition and interaction with the other players.

I feel like this game is pretty hard for newbies. Some friends just jump in games like Castles of Burgundy, Viticulture or Orléans, but struggled with this game. Same for me the first 2 games. It’s less intuitive I think. I’m not sure if this one stays. Solo mode is so so without expansion. 4 player game has much downtime (sometimes 3 aswell), need several plays to start enjoying. This is a fine game, but definitly not a family weight game, maybe after the first bumbs.  I regret buying Pearlbrook, looks and art are great though. But the wonders change the base game in a bad way. Kills creativity, the game becomes a rush for pearls > wonder! I belief some expansions out there are very good though.  Sold Pearlbrook afterall  I bought moedas & co metal coins to replace the money/currency tokens.  Base + 1 expansion has a similar cost as great special edition games like Castle of Burgundy or Rococo. With these editions you have much more value for you €  I wanna love it, but I cannot find the joy in the game like I have in others games. It feels like there is always just a small thing why it doesn’t work for me/my group. And yet, I can’t let it go for now.  Update from 8 to 7.5.

In many ways, this is more frustrating than a deckbuilder which tend to rely on synergy between faction cards instead of more restrictive building/animal pairings.  The gameplay felt more mechanical than its charming theme.   The decision re: husband that provides resources during the Production phase and wife who is only worth VP's at the end of the game is also dodgy",199792
5471,SageClock,8.5,"A very solid mix of worker placement, tableau/engine building, and hand management with gorgeous artwork and great resource bits. The tree is a bit extra, though, and I haven't bothered to put it together yet.  Only played solo so far, but even on the first level Rugwort poses a challenge. Relatively simple to set up and fairly quick to play solo as well, with simple A.I. management. I can see myself bringing this out fairly often whenever I have 45 minutes to kill.  I do wish it had more of a different arc to each game, which I'm hoping Spirecrest will add (planning to grab that with the next Kickstarter, and probably the new expansion also since it's supposed to have more solo content).",199792

5473,SaggyUK,8,"It's get a little long especially in the last round as it's not quite the level of interaction we like which puts my 8 yr old daughter off although she loves it up until then. Am going to try to make it a little shorter somehow.  Update - we received Everdell from Secret Santa last year and as much as we loved many aspects about it, it was erring on the side of slightly not competitive enough for the time taken. However, we fiddled with the rounds to shorten it a little and decided to not allow more than one worker at each location to increase the competition and it now works well (for example my mum and daughter timed it well enough that they blocked me from stone on the board the entire game) and my daughter really enjoys it. We've added the rugwort mini expansion too just to add a few mean cards in which everyone loves. Remains perfectly balanced with the changes and we end up in the same position as regular rules.",199792

5489,Salvatore_81,7.25,"Quite enjoyable low-mid weight worker placement / tableau building game with gorgeous art and components (excluding the horrible cardboard tree). I've only played this 2-player and solo, and while the solo is pretty bad, the 2-player game actually flows very nicely.  Even though I liked the 2-player game, there are some major problems that prevent Everdell from reaching the very good game category:  1) The game is very card combo oriented and unfortunately the combos are very card specific. This increases the luck factor by huge amount, leading to games that are often either super exciting or super frustrating.  2) The cardboard tree is quite abysmal. You'd be lucky if it lasts for more than dozen of games and while you can play without it, I feel like it's a major part of the aesthetic part of the game.  3) For a family game there is just too much small print text all over the cards. The cards are also situated all over the play area, so you need to be constantly checking what the cards do. So for pure family game purposes I would recommend 7 Wonders. And if I play with seasoned players, I'd rather pick up something else.   + Nice flow + Plays relatively fast + Works well with two players + Really good art (family friendly)  - See points 1-3 above - Solo play sucks",199792
5490,Salvatortoise,6,"Everdell is certainly a looker, but in terms of gameplay it's good but not great. The worker placement element is fairly bland, the tableau-building is definitely the more interesting part of the game but even that is pretty standard. The game chooses style over substance and It has more than its fair share of frustrations as a result. Some of the text on the card is teeny-tiny, and you're supposed to be able to read it, upside-down and across the table in your buddy's tableau. Seriously?  Also there isn't a great deal of fun interaction here, just a few opponent cards that you can use and a couple of nasty take-that actions.   It's a game that your girlfriend will play though coz it's pretty darn cute and that's certainly worth something. I have much more interested worker placement games and plenty a similar tableau builders so there's no real need for me to pick this one up.",199792

5541,Saume,9.2,"I went into this not too sure if the game was overhyped or not. Well it turns out that, while it is relatively simple to learn, the combos and resource management are still quite satisfying.  My very first season left me wanting more. I thought: wow only 2 workers, you really don't get to do much. But as it turns out, you quickly start doing some combos and prolonging your seasons.  Although you're unlikely to get everything you want to perfectly combo with your ideal critter / construction combinations, you will undoubtedly have some good options. If you fixate too hard on a strategy (e.g. farm, husband and wife), you might just waste so much time waiting on cards that other players are already hiding in their hands. So in general, it is better to adapt to what shows up for you and try to do the most out of it.  My minor complaints with this game are: 1) I wish there were more ways to cycle cards from the meadow (other than at the end of the second season). 2) There should be some worker spot to remove a card from your tableau, in order to make space for another card in the late game. There are a few cards that allow you to do that, but they are few and far between (and you need to have space in your tableau to play them in the first place). 3) It would also be nice to have a way to spend extra resources at the end too, you sometimes finish with over 10 resources that are essentially useless (this point is addressed with the Spirecrest expansion).",199792

The tree on the board is beautiful, but it is pure esthetics, no real functionality It mixed the mechanics of worker placement, tableau building, engine/set-combination building. It is fairly straightforward to learn, but hard to master, as you need to have a good knowledge of the cards. Hence, new players are always at a disadvantage. Very little to non interaction. Mostly by blocking spaces on the board or by denying cards to others by taking them yourself. You mostly stare down on your own cards or meadow (cards in the center). The game is good for people who like workerplacement or table building. Better than Earth that has similarities. More advanced than Wingspan. But is it fun fun? Hm.. Good+, but not amazing.",199792

Sometimes, depending on the intial draw and cards available in the meadow (the shared space that essentially functions like a communal hand), your engine might not get going while your opponent chains together Spring bonuses right off the bat.

They each require a specific combination of 2 cards, and trying to keep track of them feels disruptive and unnecessarily difficult. I would have much preferred a system more similar to the basic events like 6 common critters or 2 of each type.   I would have liked iconography that denoted common/unique/legendary and critter/structure. It would just make counting easier for scoring. It's on there as text, but icons are easier for counting purposes than text.  I also wish there were a few more types scoring opportunities in the card pool, particularly for end game scoring.

Mit Start im Winter, durchgeht man alle 4 Jahreszeiten und jedeJahreszeit bringt neue Zyklen (haupts. durch Wiedererhalt der Worker)  Ich finde gut: -Iconografie und Regeln macht es leicht erlernbar -Sehr sehr schönes Spiel/-Material. -> u.A. toller 3D-Pappbaum als spielbarer Bereich. -tendentiell wenig Downtime, da jeder nur eine Aktion macht und den Jahreszeitenwechsel jeder indviduell durchführen kann -max. 15 Karten in seiner Auslage -> damit wird Ende auch nicht unnsinnig verlängert, wenn einer in der vorherigen Zyklen länger brauch.  nich gefallen hat mir: -Ärger-Karten (Wie z.B. Narr) finde ich unpassend. (Erzeugt das Gefühl von ""es wurde bei Spielentwicklung festgestellt, dass man gerne mehr Interaktion hätte"" und dann wurde das noch übergestülpt) -komische Art von Mangelspiel (schwer beschreibbar, da man ja zum Ende ggf. noch einige Rohstoffe über hat) -Obwohl man in unseren Partien immer gut an Karten kam, ist mir manche Kombi zu Glückslastig. -Am Ende kann es trotzdem zu ""Downtime"" kommen, wenn man auf den letzten warten muss, bis er alle Aktionen fertig hat.

5622,SerAmanda,6.5,"I thought the worker placement part of the game is kind of cool. On your turn you either play a card from your hand, OR place a worker, OR pick up all of your workers. When you pick up your workers, you ""move onto the next season"": you gain an additional worker and there may be an event you do. Other players will not always be in sync with you, which is how it is neat and interesting how it plays out (ie: most action spaces are blocked if it has a worker on it).  The main reason I am blah on this game is it is a game where repeat plays are really important to enjoyment of the game (ie: knowing what kinds of cards exist); I usually find it a negative because I often teach games to new players. It feels sort of like if you shuffled the 7 Wonders Age I and II cards into one deck; there are cards that ""if you have building XX you can play it for free!"" but will you ever get to see building XX, what is it, etc etc. There is no card drafting though, it is you have a hand of cards, there is a face-up public display, and a draw deck you sometimes can draw from.

I saw over 20 cards in the final round and nothing worth more than 2 points. It felt like I was building an engine but then not enough things to use the engine for.

5638,sgclouthier,9.25,"Already owned first edition KS game with round twigs when I re-backed the 2018 Kickstarter for the Second Printing of Collector's Edition Everdell (including everything in the standard edition, plus two sets of deluxe metal coins, wooden occupied tokens with stickers, 6 rat meeples, an upgraded D8, the Legends expansion (10 cards), Extra! Extra! Pack (15 cards), the Pearlbrook expansion and the Rugwort Pack (3 cards) and the updated second edition rulebook. It also has a spot UV cover and a gold-foiled slipcase. Pledge Level $104 +$15 (extra coins) +$18 shipping = $137, Expected: Fall 2019. Received on very last day of US fulfillment 8/23/19. 3 value coins and new twigs were missing, two starling meeples were damaged, no foot, no beak and the PB game board was bent upon arrival. Many others had problems with their fulfillment by Ship Naked.  Oct 2019 edit: Starling Games is very responsive to backers and quickly shipped replacement meeples, coins and twigs. Still awaiting the PB game board replacement.  The game itself is a tour de force, incredible artwork and table presence (it might well be the most beautiful game ever done), brilliantly designed, well integrated game mechanics, superb components and highly engaging play. Most of all it is fun. It has hit the table nearly a dozen times with PB in just the past few months supplanting many other very fine WP games attesting to its draw and replayability. In terms of base game content you get a ton. Besides maybe TM and Bunny Kingdom I cannot think of a base game with as much included. Speaking as an aspiring designer it is impressive how well all this card content integrates! As great as it is alone, Pearlbrook improves every aspect of play and we’ll never play without it unless teaching to new players. Realize you will need a lot of table space to play this game, especially with the current and planned expansions. The only gripes we have are some minor balance issues, the Rugwort cards in particular can be brutal for families and a few legendary cards appear over or underpowered, but you can easily remedy by leaving these out or house ruling a kinder, gentler rat. The cardstock evertree is also a bit difficult to assemble and edges will fray over time, definitely worth investing in the beautiful wooden upgrade for durability. Fitting all the content in the base game box is a challenge indeed, this game deserves a big box solution and we’d like to eventually see 3D resin wonders and event miniatures to replace the cardboard. Despite that we were so excited to learn of Bellfaire and Spirecrest, backed each in a heartbeat. This system has legs, I envision it’ll provide us with countless hours of entertainment for years to come.  Update April 2020: Received Bellfaire and Spirecrest KS and all add-ons 4/1/20 on time as promised despite ongoing corona pandemic which has delayed virtually every other Kickstarter project.  Added on Lincoln and Nikki Alternate Art Cards $5.00 +$4.32 shipping Dec 2021.",199792
5639,sgosaric,2.5,"Everdell is a testament to squeezing the most out of the game idea through game development. Unfortunately the basic idea is the most derivative, stale, design-by-the-numbers haven't-we-played-this-before-countless-times affair.   The strength of Everdell is the theme - no, not the eyecandy, [i]theme[/i]. Remember [i]theme[/i]? That narrative glue that ties the bits together? In case of euros like this one the goal is simply to make the game more intuitive and easier to play. So it does to tableau builders what Thunderstone did to Dominion - theme makes card synergies obvious and thus easier for players to orient themselves. Plus, it's kinda cute watching these critters building up your city -  a similar vibe as Dream Home, but with engine building and more complexity.   However. .  1. The core of the game is really in the cards. The whole resource gathering worker placement thing around it ... uninspired and kinda ... [i]really? You glued Stone Age to tableau builder?[/i] At least there's not many workers to place though the duration of the game. But the stale euro bit of the yesteryear doesn't stop there, no, there's also the overused decaying concept of switching from engine to points production. This time in the form of goal cards and tiles to score. And the ""clever"" each-player-has-its-own-worker-replenishment cycle is as interesting as other countless ""twists"" on worker placement template.  2. The eyecandy bit. The board and the cardboard tree are really just a waste of paper, Chinese labour force and space on the table. We could also survive with more generic resource representation.  3. BGG thinks this is a family game ... [i]bwahahaha![/i] No, it's just mid-heavy generic euro with Disney factor.    Everdell does get the most out of this workerplacement MPS tableu concept - it kinda finishes what Seasons failed at. It's just that the concept is stale to begin with.",199792

The game is a table hog with 0,0001 interaction between players. The only fair selling point is that girls around me are screaming from how much they like the artwork.  The balance between experienced players and new players is non-existent. 3 of us were on the third season while the owner of the game was still doing millions of actions in a chain fashion in season one.

Gather resources with workers, pay them to 'build' cards, the winner will be the one who best combines cards together - with the caveat that luck can play a big part in what cards you're able to build.   All that said though, Everdell does what it does pretty well, offering small ways to mitigate that luck of the draw and crucially, not outstaying its welcome (as long as you're not playing with the AP-prone). So whilst it doesn't do anything special, it's still an enjoyable game that my eldest especially took a liking to.

5676,shaveandahaircut,7,"[2 plays] Rating could rise, there was a bunch to learn in the first game which slowed things down a lot. First impression is that this might be best with less than 4.   Pros: simple rule set, beautiful art and components, big “cute” factor, and variable set up which means each game will be somewhat different. Cons: Lots of combos and effects to keep track of, simple rules means each card serves as a mini subset of the rules instead, huge potential for analysis paralysis, and we found ourselves needing to walk around the table to look at the tiny print on other’s cards.  Update: Raised rating to a 7 after second playing 2 years later. We missed a couple things in my first play with the kids, so the game play was better. The artwork is really, really cute and the set-up almost belies a whimsical kids game, however, the game would not be suitable for less than experienced gamers.

5684,Sherbert93,9,"Everdell is a brilliantly designed game with a heartwarming theme that resembles the universe of Redwall, but with much less conflict (if you seek anthropomorphic conflict, check out Root).  As you play, you are building constructions (buildings) and inviting critters (animals) to your city from cards either in your hand or in the public ""meadow"" up to a maximum of 15 critters/constructions. The gameplay uses classic worker placement and city-builder mechanics, but has the added gameplay of transitioning to new seasons - which not only allows you to take back your workers to place them again, but also gives you special bonuses and more workers to place in the new season.  Each card, which has either constructions or critters, has a unique pairing of the other type. If the construction is placed in your city first, you get to play the associated critter for free which adds an element of efficiency when it comes to how you play. This is unidirectional, so playing the critter before the construction does not reduce the cost of either.  As you and your opponents vie to build constructions and invite critters to make the most harmonious city possible, you also have special goals that you can achieve based on the kind of cards you play - but these are all public knowledge so you'll have to be the first to claim them!  What makes Everdell such a finely developed game is the pace of individual play. Many times, players are forced to change seasons early, before playing any cards into their city, while other players can play for a few more rounds if they get the right cards in play. If done improperly, this could leave to a player or two finishing their game well before other players. But even at 4 players, players often finish the end of their final season at approximately the same time. It is a hallmark of a well designed game to allow for individual pacing, but still ensure that each player ends the game at the same time.  The game is good at 2, but the sheer number of cards can reduce the chance to see special events come to fruition. At 4, the game is the most satisfying, as each worker placement space can house an additional worker - so each player likely will get the materials they need to play 15 cards. But this game shines at 3 players, as there is significant tension between players as they vie for the same places on the board.  I would recommend this game to just about anyone. It is satisfying to play, the production quality is fantastic, and it has plenty of replayability and interaction between players, without creating serious conflict. 9/10",199792

5692,Shinako,5,"More of a card game that uses worker placement to manage resources, doesn't really feel like a worker placement. Fairly light worker placement, easier to play than the 2.8 bgg weight would suggest. Closer to Century than Viticulture in difficulty.  It's a decent worker placement/resource management game, maybe just a little more heavy than traditional gateway games. I'm just not a huge fan of games where you draft resources and turn them in directly for points, they all feel the same to me. There needs to be an extra step between the drafting and the points in order for the game to interest me.",199792
5693,ShirKhan,7.1,"It does have a bit of a ""hundreds of cards to read"" problem, and it can get really slow when a player thinks too long. Overall a solid game though, perhaps reminding me a bit of Terraforming Mars with regards to having many cards but still being playable.",199792

5730,Simulacrum,6,"[2019-03-02] Tablóépítő, munkáselhelyezős játék. A játékosok kártyákat kapnak a kezükbe, illetve a játéktéren is mindig szerepel bizonyos mennyiségű lap, ezekből építhetnek 15-öt összesen a játék során. Kezdetben két munkást kapnak, majd évszakváltáskor még egyet-egyet, majd végül 2 újabbat. Csak az évszakváltásokkor kapja vissza mindenki a munkásait, így egy játék során összesen 15-ször rakhat le mindenki. Az érdekesség, hogy az évszakváltásokat mindenki egyedileg teheti meg, tehát elképzelhető, hogy már valaki előrébb jár a játékban a másiknál. Lemaradni azonban nem érdemes, mert az utolsó évszakban vannak olyan pontok, amelyeken győzelmi pont szerezhető és aki későn kerül ide lemarad. A kártyák szépek, de elég sok szerencsét visznek bele, mert vannak, amik egymással kombóznak és ha nem sikerül begyűjtenünk őket, akkor kevesebbet érnek. A 7 Csodához hasonlóan van ingyen építés a lapok között. A játék kivitelezése nagyon szép, bár a csak dizájnként benne levő összerakható nagy fát elhagyhatták volna. A játék elsőre csak ismerkedés lehet. Az élvezetes játékhoz minimum egy második partira szükség van, amiben a lapokat már ismerik a felek.

The graphics suggest that this is a game for the whole family - meanwhile, it is a card game that requires attention, with a lot of text on the cards and need to deal with several cards at the same time and search for combos. I wonder how many parents bought this game because of a fairy tale cover to realize that this is the 14plus position (as described on the box).

The art has its charm, but otherwise there are other games that do pretty much everything this game does better. In terms of feel, I'd describe it as a way more boring Race for the Galaxy - the worker placement doesn't feel ""necessary"" per se and there are way less interesting decisions for the time spent playing this game.  Still, it has its charm, and it is very approachable! I do sometimes like coming back to it for its familiarity and comfort. I think it's a really good way to introduce players to several mechanisms. It's not punishing and is at least mildly pleasant.  Only expansion I've tried is Spirecrest. Got rid of that; we both felt like it actively made the game worse. The game is fine as is.",199792

5769,Skarmy,5,"I love worker placements with heavy strategy, ie brass, viticulture, Le Havre; I hate whatever this mess of mechanics is trying to be. The entire game is way too random.   Too difficult to control what goes in and out of your hand and no way to reliably build combos or an engine, it's literally just hope you get what you need or hope your opponent doesn't randomly draw into an insane engine while you're struggling to scrounge together enough food to pay for the workers you have to feed out of pocket since you can't  draw into any of your combo buildings.   Unnecessarily harsh space blocking in addition to the random engine piece alottment makes it even more impossible to make any sort of strategic plan so you have to rely on wishing that you are can actually go to the placements you need since you can't actually build anything because nothing in your hand matches and it takes 3 turns and almost all your workers just to replenish your hand so that next season MAYBE you can build something.  Fine if you don't want a strategic worker placement or want something that heavily uses the ""lots of luck to pull down good players so newbies can maybe compete if they're also lucky"". Cute art, high quality materials, but not a game for me.",199792

It's really easy to have blown a hearty load in the second season and prematurely filled your tableau because there's so many combos you can get swept up in without noticing you're 13 cards in with 2 seasons to go. There's still a lot you can do after filling it but that only mitigates the pit fall so much. There's so much depth to this game for such an adorable and beautiful theme. The components are out standing, best production I own. It is just an absolute joy to play and the big highlight for me is the solo mode. It's very well implemented, leaves no components in the box like most games. The ai rolls a d8 to determine which of 8 cards in the shared pool it takes for scoring, helping to cycle in new cards and shake up your plans by sometime taking the next card in the combo you're setting up.

That being said, Everdell's vibes are really not my jam, and worker-placement interaction is not often my favorite style of game.  Ultimately, this left my collection because I'd much rather play Ark Nova or Castles of Burgundy, as those games feel similar enough, but are just all-around better games.   I could see you loving this game if the theme really fits your style, but this happy animal sanctuary often feels cloying and I am personally unable to put myself into the game in a meaningful way.

5810,Sluke1090,8,"I love the components of this game. The tree is certainly more fashion over function but it makes for a pretty fun playing experience. There is a big negative though with the tree: it makes it so that you can't have 4 people sitting around the board as you can most games. A player cannot sit behind the tree and still play the game conveniently.  I love the 4 resources though and the cards are top notch. Top of my head, I can't think of better looking playing cards in a game.   To the gameplay itself, I like the hand management and worker placement. You have to make tough decisions for efficiency and the city card limit makes a really tough challenge. I wish there more cards to help you remove things from your city, but the Dungeon and University definitely help there.   The Fool might be my least favorite card in a game.",199792

The art is great, and the tree is totally overproduced but adds to the theme. The resources, which are fun pieces as well, have to be managed to help you gain cards and then those cards help you to have an engine to increase the power of your cards. You actually have a bit more time to get everything done than it first appears, and there's a balance between getting quality cards in your tableau and just getting something out there so you can maximize the amount you score from round to round. On the surface, this appears to be light and quick, and yet I found it to be quite substantial, and it definitely scratches the itch.",199792

It's one of those engine builders that ends right when you feel like you have your engine going. My group thrives in the 3.0-4.0 weight games, yet this one has a lot of ""oh man, i totally forgot about [mechanic or bonus], ugh!"" Some of the text/color choices and lay out of the board makes it hard to see things at a glance (like the bonus cards that are on the actual tree). A lot of things get forgotten about, or when someone takes one of those bonus cards, other players have gotten upset because they couldn't see those and they were out of sight and out of mind.

5855,Solipsiste,8,"A clever worker placement that emphasizes card combinations. It features stunning cartoon art and a perfectly pleasant setting. It always seems like you are struggling to get resources and that workers are scarce, yet. you still end up with a a full city by the end. The seasons mechanisms is an interesting twist, even if it feels rather odd to have players in different seasons but in the same space blocking each other (thinking about, it's even really weird). The downside is that some players finish the game much earlier than other players. I was worried the winner would almost always be the player who finishes after everyone else, but the limit of 15 cards built and the ""journey"" track (points only available in the last season) seem to give a chance to players who were not able to chain more actions than others before moving on.   On the minus side, the opening hand is quite important and might give some players a chance to do much more in the first season, which in turn often gives them a better second season, and so son. There is some luck in the draw of the cards that go together, but it's manageable. Some variation is introduced through special events and forest cards that can change each game, but replayability is slightly limited and expansions add mechanisms that bloat the game (while also being excessively pricey).  Very good game and a keeper.",199792

But even more important is that I love the game play. Worker placement with some neat tweaks. You either place a worker or play a card while your critters build their city and prepare for the next seasons. It runs so nicely, there is always something to do, always cards you want to use, and if not you move to the next season! Game flow is perfection in this. It also is a very nice game, meaning not very confrontational and kind of pleasant in its vibe which is such a nice change. Plus, I love the animal figurines, I was the squirrel!! This just so cute!

Everdell's progression in decision space is off-the-charts as it builds up from a breezy experience early game to a tense, AP-inducing mid to end game. Everdell's aesthetics truely brings the game to life and apart from some upkeep during changing seasons, the game has no phases (which I love!) and quick turns (which I love!).  I know Everdell suffers from ""luck of the draw""; in games where you find the right cards you quickly get your engine going and score big points, in games where you don't, your engine will be suboptimal and it's hard to do well. If that's a big deal for you, I can imagine skipping Everdell alltogether. For me, even when I don't see the cards I need, I find enough joy in trying to play I do have as best I can.

One- the obnoxious 3D tree which has to be assembled and taken apart each time you play - and quickly shows signs of wear.  Would have been a better game without it.

I've never really understood what people meant when they say that a game is overproduced, because I really enjoy when a good game has great components and stunning artwork.

Feels like you can get some cool combos going, but other times it feels like the game just rewards you for having certain specific cards together for no interesting reason.

5947,stainedglasshouse,7,"This is a great game - solid tableau building with worker placement, great artwork, beautiful design. I would gladly rank it a 8 but docked it a full point because of the tree. This tree serves no purpose, makes the cost of the game much higher than it needs to be, and even detracted from the game. Because of the goals being no on the board but under and on top of the tree I found myself never really looking until someone at the table finally reminded me of them.  Still a wonderful game, but it is more of a $40/$45 game.",199792

5949,StalkingButler,7,"Beautiful looking tableau builder.  Played once with 2.  I'm not huge on most games where the main draw is going looking for the overpowered combos and pulling them off.  This game is all about combos, big and small, as each construction allows you to play a certain critter for free.  Getting lucky and drawing these cards is a huge part of the battle.  The rest of the game is a wobbly worker placement where you grab resources to pay for the cards.  I feel like I can see the seams where these two genres were stitched together.  The 4 player game sounds atrocious, but while the 2-player game was functional, it felt like it was missing something.  You do not make it through the whole deck, and the worker placement felt lacking.  3 does seem seem like it would be the sweet spot.    That's a lot of complaining for what is ultimately a pretty decent game.  Playing your cards and pulling off your combos IS fun, and the cards are well-designed enough that there are some pretty interesting things you can do.  The mini-expansion I played with seemed pretty unnecessary.",199792

5959,StarletPhoenix,8,"gorgeous production value. really liked the different critter meeples.  worker placement meets engine building; I definitely feel like ability to better strategize will come with a few plays and knowledge over all the different cards and possible combos.  there really are a lot of cards, which will add to the replayability of this game.  when I was watching playthroughs and reading that your town can hold up to 15 cards (and then seen how few workers we have to be able to do it with) I thought there was no way I'd ever be able to fill it.  but I did.    a con is the tiny font size on the cards is definitely a problem.  I was hoping this issue would get fixed in this printing but it wasn't.  needing to pick up and look at cards all the time to be able to read and see the ""free"" associated critter was rather a damper.  however like above I am hoping that the more familiar we get with the cards the less often we will need to do that and we can focus more on the fun.  + Pearlbrook",199792

We also enjoy the cute meeples :)  There are plenty of win strategies to choose from.  We really like Pearl Brook. The game really profits from the extra options introduced by the expansion.  You can be a bit screwed by not getting the right cards early on. Particularly green producers like a farm are important to get into the seasonal flow. But even if you get a late start you can still win. The card pool is rather huge - so discard/redraw is an important part of strategy.

6008,Stexe,6.75,"Some interesting ideas and flow with worker placement and tableau / engine building. But it often feels very aggressive and overly punishing at times out of sheer luck. So many cards synergize or specifically reference other cards that having them in your initial hand (or lucking into drawing them) is huge.  Some combos can really shut down other people. Getting a building that can hire someone for free to the right of someone else? Snap it up every time. Fool card thrown at an already tight game can just destroy someone if played at the correct moment.  It has some neat concepts, but it really bogs itself down with so many cards referencing other cards that you have to look out for. Also, the iconography and card design leaves a lot of room for desire. The giant tree is super gimmicky and doesn't help at all.",199792

No player aids is completely unforgivable when you also have entirely-blank player boards, and much of the board is lacking critical rules information despite there being massive amounts of open space. As for the actual game, when Everdell wasn't being actively aggravating, it was a 50/50 split between tense and strategic, and boring and AP-inducing.

The evertree yeah it does get in the way, but I dont care, it looks awesome. 7 games in a row today with wife after receiving it, it plays at a good pace, there is a fair amount of luck and random chance to the game, for seriously competitive playerrs this may frsutrate you. But I just dont care its great fun, it looks awesome, its dripping with theme, the gameplay mechanics are really solid and tight, and evewry game is different.  A note on randomness and luck. It's definitely there, a good run of card combos or not many can be felt, but often it seems to balance out by the end of the game somewhat. In 55+ plays now, I'd say I've had only 2 or 3 that have juat felt like a 'bad game' nothing went well. And probably a similar number of those magic games where everything comes together perfectly for a mega score. I don't think you can ask for more without going for a scythe or chess style total strategy heavy game  No having played SPirecrest many times, Pearlbrook a couple of times and dabbled with Bellfaire assymetric powers.

Well, at least, I assume it's a master piece, never in the history of anything has a game on BGG been overrated, after all! So this is a resource collection worker placement games. The main reason to collect resources is to allow you to play cards that do fun stuff and/or give you points. The core rules are super straight forward. But careful planning is required to play efficiently and what resources you get and what order you play the cards in is what this game is all about. I thought this was completely fine. It's a run of the mill resource collection worker placement game, spruced up with some fun card effects. It plays well, it doesn't overstay it's welcome, there is decent interaction by way of competing for spots on the board or getting certain things before some other player does. But it's nothing we haven't seen before. And sure, it's put together competently. And it is not less then the sum of it's parts. It's also not more. It's a perfectly fine game.  ===== Components =====  The art on this game is super pleasing to look at. Nicely detailed, nice colors, well proportioned, cute animals and buildings. The graphic design is mostly good, but there are a few dumb issues, like having dark brown wood icons on a dark brown background. How did this get past play testing? I was annoyed that simple things like ""gain X resources"" on cards are explained with words. There is no good reason for this. The lingo of available, well known iconography for these basic things is well established. Sure, some cards do need text, but many don't. A missed opportunity. But let's get to the elephant in the room. Well, it's not an elephant, it's a cardboard monstrosity posing as a tree. It is huge, it serves little purpose and - at least in the copy I was playing -  doesn't last. Edges were frayed, parts were bent and one part had been ripped off. Not great. But worst of all: this overproduced, pointless piece of eye candy blocks the view and doesn't quite leave enough space for some of the other components on the table. I get it, it looks nice in pictures, if taken from the correct angle, but come on, think of the practicality please!  ===== Rule book =====  I have not read the rule book from start to finish, but I have used it for looking stuff up. And the impression I get is that they wanted to keep the rules simple and easy to digest. Too bad that by doing this, they lost some much needed granularity. Quite often we had to decide as a group how to interpret a rule or a card. Why doesn't the rule book specify that if a card tells you to put things on it, where those things come from? The supply or the player's stash? The fact that there are more then 1400 threads on BGG about the rules says a lot.

6081,SuzukiGen,7,デッキのdbg成分が比較的低く、むしろデッキをコントロールする術がないと言う、ある意味反人間的（スクラッチ）な、革新的な設計になっているのです。 ただ、個人的にはこのビルドモードの真髄は体験しておらず、むしろビルドすらしないほうがいい感じなので、今のところ加点はできませんね。 それから、右側はリニアではないので、本当は右側のサブトラックが主な得点源になるはずで、ここの数値的なつらさを考えると、ゲームの多様性が足りず、ルートが一辺倒になりすぎているように感じます。 しかし、全体的にルールは難しくなく、背景もよくデザインされています。 考えることによる見返りが神引きに追いつきそうな点で、ランダム性に対して考える量が少し大きすぎるのです。 1点の微減なので、ほぼ7点ですね。,199792

6084,sverbeure,6,"Fun, light engine builder with amazing component and art quality. I didn't like the game as much as I had hoped. It can be frustrating when you have cards in hand that you are holding onto because you really want the card that goes with it to get this great combo or play it for free, but if it never comes out or someone snatches it from under your nose it can feel frustrating... but that's life, you have plenty of other things to do and explore in this game. But it stings when another player has all the luck in the world with all the right cards for their engine showing up at just the right time. I did like the season mechanic that allows players to play at a different pace, and the overall feel of the game. Will happily play again when offered, but don't need to own it. I would recommend this game if you are looking for a light-medium engine builder. If you want more grease in your engine, look elsewhere.",199792

This game combines introductory-level aspects of card drafting and worker-placement as well as the concept of engine building which makes it easier for new and young board game players to enjoy!   My only negative comments is that the past few times I played it, I felt like I was constantly on the edge as to what I wanted to complete before the game ended. I think that the trade-off between getting end- game bonuses as opposed to using your workers to get resources so I can play more cards is not worth it because playing cards is FUN and putting workers on end-game bonuses IS NOT FUN. Also, the journey space you can use in autumn is also a prime example of how using workers to get VP is not fun at all. Last thing, the tree you build, yeah I accidentally bent it the first time putting it together. It's my fault I know but expect that thing to get worn out after repeated use.

Even when looking past the cuteness overload and the extremely pretty art, the game thankfully manages to deliver on the gameplay aspect as a good medium-light worker placement and engine-builder of an euro. Turns are fast as you're pretty much only ever either placing a worker or adding a card to your tableau, but the managing your cards and resources and finding the correct timing to do things in is interesting.  Trying to best use your limited workers and resources in an effort to chain together multiple freebies is a really fun exercise. On the first round it starts out feeling really tight and like you're never going to get anything going, but there's a ridiculously entertaining ramping up element to the game where you're eventually getting massive amounts of resources and workers to accomplish a lot of things with. On the downside though, it can feel a little bit lucky with the card draws when you're really needing certain combinations to come up and it's just not working out, but this element is diminished when playing with more players as you start cycling through the deck quicker.  It's also a little bit more fiddly and not as smooth as something like Wingspan, as trying to keep track of all the possible conditional effects in the late game and seeing if others have available worker placement spots on their tableau can get a little bit cumbersome. The base game also kind of ran out of steam for me very quickly, but thankfully there's a lot of expansions available to mix things up and keep the game feeling fresh.",199792

This combined with the uniqueness of the seasons, unlocking workers, and being able to pass while other players are still in previous seasons adds so much variability and interesting gameplay that can occur.  The theme is phenomenal and the pairing of creatures with one another or with buildings really drive the theme home.  The only thing preventing this from knocking on my top-10 door is the fact that it suffers from the issue that many tableau games have, but to an even greater degree: it is difficult to see what is in-front of other players, and the text and some symbolism is very small, making it very difficult to see what other players are going for or need.",199792

6155,tankbard,7.2,"Everdell seems to have the same problem as Imperial Settlers, in that it's an engine building game where successful engines get to play more game than the unsuccessful ones. This is exacerbated in Everdell where you are also competing with players more directly for drafting order on a common market, whereas in Imperial Settlers this competition is limited to purely random draws from the Common deck and the occasional direct attack (which is often telegraphed and moderately costly to the attacker as well). In Everdell these disparities are created primarily through RNG, whereas in Imperial Settlers there's RNG but also Faction deck familiarity. In both cases, the worst-off players can end up sitting idle for 10+ minutes while the winning players do fancy tricks.  These are both games I want to like but being stuck like that is a pretty bad feeling, and the chances for it remain the same even as player skill increases. Perhaps there's a way to mitigate it with a scaling bonus on Prepare for Season, i.e. when you Prepare for a Season you get some small bonus for each player who has not yet prepared for that season (since those are the players who are doing more engine things and therefore are ahead).",199792

Every aspect of the gameplay is well balanced, and leaves you on fun missions to create the most thriving community of critters and buildings that you can. Thematically this can get anyone to the table, and is such a breath of fresh air compared to the countless merchant or medieval games out there in the same category. My only very minor quibbles with the game are the small font on cards can lead to easy game-altering misses, and it is honestly a bit tricky to keep track of all the triggers by the end of the game.

6171,Tattie,9,"Everdell, is a ridiculously cute worker placement, resource management, card drafting game. The designers really took the woodland creature theme and ran with it. From the Everdell tree overlooking the meadow board, the player pieces (mice, squirrels, rabbits and hedgehogs), thematic  creature and building cards, and resources (berries, twigs, stones, and amber) all of it comes together to make a childhood fantasy come true.   You should not let this game’s cutesy exterior fool you, it is a very strategic game. You’re tasked with building a small town (maximum of 15 cards, made up of a combination of critters and constructions) over 4 seasons or rounds. You use your workers to gather resources and execute various actions. Once you can no longer take any action you change seasons (rounds) by collecting your workers back to you and taking the appropriate end of season action(s). In this way a player might find themselves in a different season (or stage of the game) than their opponents. The game ends for you once you can no longer take an action in the final season. Once everyone completes season 4 points are tabulated and the winner is declared.  The most common complaints about the game are with the components, they are: 1 - The small print on the cards. 2 - The assembly of, and the space taken by, the Everdell tree. Yes, the print on the cards is small but, I think it’s a minor complaint. This game is large, and has a great table presence. If the cards were much bigger it would really impede playability, there wouldn’t be enough room on a standard sized table. Our table is just about 3ft wide x 6ft long and running a 3 player game takes up most of the real estate. As for the Everdell tree I know some people opt to keep it assembled and on display rather than risk wear & tear of assembly and disassembly each time they play. Others opt to play the game without the Everdell tree at all. The function of the tree isn’t integral to the game play, you can make your own work around. For me though, the Everdell tree is a must, it just wouldn’t be the same without it, the game would lose some of its charm. The other game components are very good and any game with wooden playing pieces gets bonus points from me.   Although this game has a timeline, 4 seasons, and a clearly defined end, it can run long. A typical 3 player game takes about 2-3 hours. As with any strategy game, turns can become slow with players looking to take the most optimal action. This doesn’t bother me too much because I enjoy Everdell that much, it also allows me time to figure out my best move. Teaching this game to less experienced players might take a bit of time and a play through to get everyone comfortable for a competitive game. I don’t think I’d use this as an introductory into the world of board games due to its complexity and run time.  There are a few expansions out for Everdell but I believe the base game offers a lot of fun and replay value. Out of the three expansions I’ve played (Pearlbrook, Bellfaire and Spirecrest) Spirecrest adds the most to the base game. The others, although all on theme, didn’t seem to add as much to the game play.   All in all Everdell offers its players a bit of whimsy, a lot of charm and a great strategic game. I don’t currently own a copy however; it is #1 on my wish list. I’ll skip the expansions for now but may eventually invest in Spirecrest. Everdell is a 9 out of 10 for me.",199792

6182,TeamAbsolute,5.5,"It’s OK - but all rather bland. There’s not a lot to it, despite the rules being too fiddly for most family gamers. It probably doesn’t help that I’m irrationally irritated by the anthropomorphic animals theme and cutesy art.",199792

The game is easy to play and every game plays differently. Resource management can be tricky when you have several tasks to accomplish, and deciding how to direct your efforts can be delightfully frustrating. A great game to introduce to people, and easy to teach. I can't see anyone not liking it, but then I'm sure there's one! This makes a beautiful and worthwhile addition to any collection, and on a rainy Sunday afternoon you'll find yourself reaching for the box and rushing to immerse yourself in Everdell and its lovely atmosphere.",199792

6188,Technarius,7,"Not a bad game for casual players, but if you dive deep into the hobby, this game becomes too random, too swingy in comparison to other worker placement games.  Of course you can play a lot of combinations, but there are too many ""good"" and ""bad"" combinations and sometimes the path to victory is determined by the cards in your hand.",199792
6189,techstocklava,7,"At first I was confused why this is often compared to Wingspan, other than the cute theme and family friendly weight. But after multiple games, I'm getting a similar feeling, of trying to build some kind of ""engine"" that in most games won't actually do anything until right before the game ends if at all. In both games it's totally possible to get some neat synergies going and just keep building on them. But it's also possible, and more common in my experience, that you just get a scattered collection of parts where a couple of pieces fit together here, a couple there, you wince and make the best of it and then the game is over. And somehow it still felt just a bit too long?  I like this more than Wingspan, it's more interactive at least. Some aspects, like the game's four resources, feel really well designed. Games where things come together a little can be very fun. But games where I find myself just doing what it takes to make a point don't leave me feeling very satisfied, I think I've just played out all of my innate interest in point optimization euros.",199792

6199,tektonik,6,"A good tableau builder, with light worker placement in getting just enough resources to build your 'city.' Simple enough to teach newer players, but complex in how you can trigger combos amongst the cards in your city to get more resources, more cards, or more points. Players also can compete for basic and special events (like mini-goals) to get even more points.  The solo mode against the AI Rugwort is....meh. It generates points off your card plays, which discourages you from using some cards over others because it would be a net negative points for you vs the AI. It's an interesting challenge, but because of how the points it generates pushes you to play a certain way, it loses the greater variety you get when playing with people. I feel like if you want to solo, you're better off playing two-handed if you want a 'fuller' experience.",199792

6202,TEN27,10,"What a gem of a game! Initially I was sold on Everdell just based on the production and art of and within the game itself. Even now, Everdell is one of, if not the single most beautiful game in my entire collection. Sometimes setting up a bigger game can be a little tedious, but with Everdell, it's like a little work of art every time.   I didn't end up giving the game a chance for a long while after I bought it however, and that was a huge mistake. The game was such a satisfying engine building experience. It's competitive and cut-throat without feeling mean. It keeps your brain busy as you juggle all the potential avenues you can take with your strategy. Overall, there is never truly a dull moment in Everdell.   Everdell slammed right into the #1 spot of my favorite games of all time -- and luckily I was in time to back the Everdell Complete Collection (so looking forward to MANY, MANY more games of Everdell!)",199792

6204,tenny09,9,"Worker and card management feels tight. At the surface, the game is very accessible but there is a depth to strategy with it and means to pivot strategy if a preferred initial card lineup doesn't meet hopes/expectations. I can see each game where I can improve, and how to better optimize card selection in my city to better enable certain end game conditions in terms of event cards.

6206,ten_oclock_scholar,9,"I adore this game. The production is gorgeous and the art is charming and inviting. But this isn't just window dressing. The game itself is very fun and offers just the right amount of complexity without grinding the game to a halt. As far as engine builders go, this is my favorite – I love trying to extend my season as long as possible and setting myself up for big plays in later seasons. The mechanics are smooth and easy to teach, and the different forest spaces offer a good deal of variability to the set-up so that the value of resources in the game changes every time you play. The deck is chock full of possible combos, and even if you're waiting on a specific card, you never feel completely hamstrung. There's always *something* you can do. The one criticism I have is that, in the base game, the meadow can sometimes get clogged with cards that nobody wants. Newleaf fixes this with the train station, which effectively increases the size of the meadow, and with the addition of a worker placement spot that lets you flush the meadow.   Rating is for the base game + Newleaf.",199792
6207,TeQuila126,6.5,"The game is beautiful but the gameplay especially the engine building could be better. The work placement is good but the deck building is based on specific combos. Besides that, you need to know the majority of the cards. It would be more interesting to do combos with unexpected cards and not waiting for luck and get the cards you want. For example, mixing this card with this card does an ok combo and not I chose a card and now I will need that specific card to do a combo. I think it would make the game more interesting. Maybe some expansions solve this.",199792

The tree is the worst component I have ever seen in a board game: unnecessary, it deteriorates easily and makes it difficult to see cards. The game lacks depth, rhythm, and is anti-climactic. In the opinion of other users, the expansions are expensive and unnecessary. I honestly do not understand the success of this game, perhaps it is due to that ""Oh, it's so beautiful"" that many argue. I don't see interest in it either as a family game (there are many better ones), or as a starter game or as a filler or as a party. An opportunistic game that thanks to copying mechanics, simplicity and childish aesthetics has managed to convince many casual players.

Rather, be taken in by the theme- you are forest critters preparing for winter with less than a year to do so. And this is not an easy feat to properly do. You have to plan ahead, react to given situations, combine what naturally belongs together, and be careful to leave some vacant spaces behind since you definitely might need them later on.

6359,Thunkd,7,"Everdell is a worker placement, tableau building game that takes place over four seasons. It's a game that starts slow and ramps up over the course of the game.  Mostly what you're doing is gathering resources to build constructions (buildings/dwellings) and critters (cute anthropomorphic animals). These go into your tableau and give you points and usually either a one-time windfall, production (which triggers immediately and at the beginning of Spring and Fall), an action spot, or an ongoing ability.  You start the game with two meeples. The things you can do on your turn are place a meeple on an action spot or build a card from your hand or from the public display.  The actions on the board are mostly about getting wood, resin and stone (all building materials primarily used for construction) or berries (primarily used for critters) or cards.  The game has a couple of painful limitations. You can never draw a ninth card. And you can never build more than 15 things to your tableau. Also, there are some cards marked ""unique"" that you can't duplicate in your tableau.  There's a bunch of ways to flush your hand of cards to either get resources or other cards and doing so is probably a good idea as a bunch of the game is about getting card synergies. One of the reasons for this is that there's a chaining ability between a construction and a matching critter. If you have the appropriate construction you can hire the matching critter for free. Once you've done that once, that construction is done chaining and can't claim another critter.  One of the interesting things about the game is that it's broken into four seasons. After you've placed all your meeples, you can ""prepare"" for the next season. Which simply means you give up a turn so that you can get the season bonus and take all your meeples back. In Spring you get a third meeple and your production buildings trigger. In Summer you get a fourth meeple and you draw two cards. In Autumn you get a fifth and sixth meeple and your production buildings trigger again. When you choose to go into a new season doesn't affect anyone else. Everyone keeps taking turns in turn order, without pausing. So you might be in autumn when another player has just entered summer.  There's a couple of special action spots on the board that are randomized from a large deck of cards, so every game will have a different set of options. There's also four 3 point events in play that you can claim with a meeple that are tied to the types of cards you've played, for example ""Have four production cards"". There's also special events in play that you can claim if you have the matching cards in your tableau. These are randomized from a large deck of special events and do all sorts of wonky (usually point scoring) things.  In Autumn a couple of special spaces are available that allow you to discard cards for a point each (discard 5, discard 4, etc.) And there's a space that can't be blocked that allows everyone to discard 2 cards for points.  In our play one player ended up getting a really great start playing some constructions that allowed him to claim critters and everything he played were production cards. The other two players didn't have much they could do in the first season and quickly advanced to spring, and without production cards didn't generate any resources. The great start player stayed in winter much longer and got a ton of resources when he finally advanced to spring. This actually ended up hurting him at the end of the game though. He went into Autumn and had a ton of resources from all his production buildings, but all those productions buildings took up a bunch of his 15 card tableau and he had no room to build things. So most of his resources and meeples in Autumn went to waste as he couldn't do very much.  There's some cards that let you fire or tear down other cards in your tableau. And there's some critters that don't count against your tableau limit or can share a spot with another critter. But mostly, you're very limited in what you can build. So planning ahead is really important. And I'll stress this again... card synergies are huge. Getting a construction that lets you hire a critter for free is something you want to do.  I enjoyed this game. It's beautiful with adorable animal artwork. There's a three dimensional tree thingy with different levels which is cool. The game starts off with players doing almost nothing, but as you go through the game you get more meeples and cards with abilities that let you do cool things so by the end of the game you're doing a ton of stuff, especially if you can chain cards so that construction A lets you claim critter B that does some special action like allowing you to put down critter C which then triggers something else. You'll definitely feel limited by your number of meeples, your hand limit of 8 cards and your tableau limit of 15 cards. Which is painful but really forces you to focus.",199792

The ideia is that players will use their cards in hand plus those open on the board, in order to make their tableaus in such a way to be able to fulfill objectives, gain points and acquire resources, with a hard limit of 15 cards played on each tableau, which will require some luck and digging to find the best cards for your intentions. Once 4 rounds are over, the game ends, and the person with the most points will be the winner!  [thing=199792][/thing] works nicely specially in that family setting, since interaction is quite in the low end - just some dispute over the common goals, plus a few cards that give cards/resources to someone else. Is enough to make feel like the others at the table actually matter, but way off from anyone really making a direct influence over what anyone is doing. On the other hand, it is a on the heavier side of a family game, not mainly to just play, but to properly do well.  With a gorgeous production - somewhat overblown in the central tree - and beautiful art, is the type of game that calls for attention whenever it hits the table, which can bring interested folk over to try it, and convince some people to give it a go. While not properly difficult in rules and not a whole lot of depth, it demands some planning, paticularly in order to make the best of the 15 slots available for the cards. Still, the concern I have is that [thing=199792][/thing] doesn't feel 'strategic' - you just get dealt a hand of cards and try and use them efficiently - it's more about lucking into combos and free critters (because you coincidentally drew the building it lives in), and while it's entertaining enough, it's just not satisfying at the end when you look at your tableau and it doesn't tell a story of 'your' strategy - it's just the best of the cards you happened to draw.   Overall, [thing=199792][/thing] is way more an uneven mess than I thought. Your first season feels like total shit. Like, it's so easy to not get a single satisfying combo at the start due to the limited actions/card selection, and the bonus production at the end of spring means that someone can easily get a much better ""engine"" just from getting lucky with their beginner hand. There's nothing satisfying at all about starting with nothing. Then, by the time it's the last turn, you're probably drowning in resources but you have no room in your tableau, or you're too split between using your workers to grab the special events or spend your useless resources. The struggle doesn't feel like a GOOD decision struggle though. It's just unsatisfying. Aiming for the special events in the first place is a total crapshoot, especially solo or with lower player counts where you'll just never see the right cards. In the end, while I would be up for a play, I can't really recommend nor would willingly ask for it.",199792

6366,Tiderion,8,"Everdell doesn't stand out as an extraordinarily deep game in any way.  It's far less complex than most of the other worker placement games I've played, and exponentially shorter per play session.  These, however, are all strengths.    The first you thing you notice about this game is a very charming art style, and good quality game components.  The one exception to this is the Evertree which, while a very neat addition to the game, is not super durable as me and my son discovered after only a few sessions.  It's not 100% necessary, as you can certainly navigate the flow of the game without it, but if you're not very careful during setup and tear down, you might soon fine yourself without the looming center piece adorning your board, or at least be willing to ignore the scotch tape holding it together.  The game has a simple enough goal: score the most points.  This is primarily achieved by a player deploying creatures or constructions (I.e. buildings) to their city - an imaginary 3 x 5 grid on the table in front of them - which score various amounts of points at the end of the game, with possible special actions providing differing amounts of bonus points.  Generally speaking, the more points a card is worth, the more resources it requires.  Play happens in seasons - You start at the end of winter, then move into spring, then summer, then Autumn - which are divided into turns.  These turns are very simple in nature, and slightly more complex in practice - you can either place a worker on one of the many available slots (Which will grow over the course of the game), play a critter or construction, or prepare for the next season.   As far as workers, each player starts with only two to place in the first of four seasons, with that number growing to three, four, and finally six by the final season, so gameplay moves very quickly throughout the session, unless someone is just learning the game.  These workers can be deployed to gather resources, or use buildings that have been played to greater effect.  There is a very wide variety of critters and constructions to play, broken down into five major types which determine how their special actions are processed; Greens activate immediately and then at the beginning of the 2nd and 4th seasons, Flowers are only accounted for at the end of the game, etc.  Learning the types of buildings and how and when they activate can take a play or two, but the sessions go so fast you'll be a master of all but the nitty gritty rules in no time.  Preparing for the next season involves reclaiming your deployed workers so they can be used again, gaining new workers, and activating certain cards to gain resources, points, etc.  Besides its brevity, another great characteristic of Everdell is that it manages to mix consistency with randomness and allows players to decide their own path to hopeful victory.  For instance, each game has many predictable cadences such as the set amount of workers that every single player will have access to in each season.  Likewise ""basic"" resource locations are the same every playthrough, as are ""basic"" events which are point-scoring opportunities that require a predictable amount of certain card types (I.e. one event requires 4 green cards to be played in your city).  The game then throws some randomness in at the start by way of ""forrest"" cards, which are essentially random and more powerful versions of basic resource cards.  E.g., a forrest card may allow you to gather 2 of any resource of your choice with a single worker, something that isn't possible on any basic node.  You then deal four random ""special"" events that are typically more rewarding than basic events but also much more difficult to achieve since they require two specific cards in your city at the time of claiming.  The real randomness comes from the hand you're dealt at the start of the game, and which cards appear in the ""meadow"", i.e. cards that are available for anyone to play and are subsequently replenished as they're used.  The combination and strategy that scored you 50 points one game may not show up at all in a subsequent game.  I've seen very high scores all around in one game, and relatively low ones in a different game.  There is a large amount of strategy with some luck sprinkled in there, and most of the game is about adapting to the cards you and the meadow are dealt, and trying to efficiently navigate the limited resource nodes that are shared by all players.  As for fiddliness and complexity, this game is almost wholly and blissfully devoid of these things.  In fact, the cards and the board itself have the things you need to know written right on the card/board itself 99% of the time.  After 2 playthroughs of the game, each less than an hour, I've only had to consult the rule book once or twice.  I normally love super complex games, but this one also satisfies a desire for more easily maneuvered rules.  Due to that, my 7 year old has picked this up with ease, and enjoyed all our playthroughs, even his losses.  All in all, this is a delightful worker placement game and an easy recommendation if you want to keep it on the simpler side of things with a shorter playtime.",199792

My partner often feels like the Basic forest locations are underwhelming and it is a waste to put workers there and that the start is very slow. I do not get this feeling but I do have one complaint about this game and that is the quality of the parts and their organisation. This is probably the most expensive game I own and I cannot really tell what the money was spent on during development. The cards in the main deck are very thin and get warped easily. The cardboard Ever Tree was damaged during first assembly (even though we put the parts together very gently), so we decided to never disassemble it and if we ever take the game somewhere we just leave the tree at home. Not that it would matter because there are no holders for the various resources, only some ziplock bags and you are supposed to pour them out onto the playing field, which I guess is good quality and sturdy, but the resources often end up on the ground and roll away. There is plenty of space in the box for some type of case for this and not just two cutouts where you can keep them in the ziplock bags. I wish a bit more thought went into that because it is really quite annoying. I guess the artwork was expensive but take for instance a game like PARKS (which is a bit cheaper than Everdell) and it features beautiful artwork from dozens of artists, wooden resources and workers, the main deck is much thicker than that of Everdell (the cards barely have any flex) and the organisation of the box is superb with separate holders included with covers for resources, heck, it even has a metal piece and all of that fits snugly into its place in the box.   And that is my take on this game. I will probably play it until the cards deteriorate beyond playability, which I assume is about 200 games if I'm careful.",199792

It's easy to learn and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It makes you want to play again to do better. Brilliant.

Jedna z najładniejszych - wygląda obłędnie:  drewniane meeple  piękne ilustracje kart - to trzeba podkreślić  jakość wykonania elementów - zwłaszcza jagody + worker playsment, którego szybko można się nauczyć + synergie między kartami + ilość kart jest spora, dzięki czemu rozgrywka jest urozmaicona + łatwa do nauki, choć potrzebne jest kilka partii by wiedzieć jakie karty mają synergię + wypraska - może szczegół, ale mając już sporo gier, to się na to zwraca uwagę  Minus: - duża ilość kart, ale czym dłużej się gra, tym bardziej odczuwa się ich powtarzalność i przydałby się dodatek (a te są za drogie)  Podsumowanie: Ta gra jest piękna. Przepiękna. Tak się powinno robić ilustracje do gier- ktoś włożył w to serce. Jakość elementów jest bardzo dobra. Gra łatwa do nauki i świetnie sprawdza jako wprowadzenie do gatunku worker playsments. Grając w grę chce się później więcej kart, bo zna się już na pamięć wszystkie .

There is nothing original here. Nor has the designer done anything to address the pitfalls that come with this style of game. Everdell is  almost entirely solitaire and requires players to track an ever-increasing amount of (mainly inconsequential) text information on cards which causes the game to drag out and become progressively less social.   Unlike something like Glory to Rome - where the escalation comes from the emergence of comically powerful synergies - Everdell requires that you manage lots of tiny bonuses to eke out an advantage.

6430,Toendra,6,"Rating after having played once, with one opponent –and just after a game of Wingspan. There's an interesting link between the two: Wingspan gives you most actions at the start –in order to give you some time to build your engine/""aviary"" – and almost halves these by the end, where Everdell gradually accumulates the number of your actions (workers). Both have magnificent artwork. But, Everdell's font can be quite small! Plus, some 'unique' cards contain 4 or more texts/lines, in different size and/or font: name/title, type, ability, related character(s), flavour,... And once your opponent(s) start(s) to build their village (read: 10+ cards) it gets increasingly difficult to follow (up). F.e. you can notice too late someone else would also be interested in grabbing certain cards from the Meadow or the (tiny!) bonus point cards. That's as far as interaction goes, actually. Because just like Wingspan, Everdell is rather ""multiplayer solitaire"". With Wingspan (base game) I just got the feeling you get an easier oversight over the state of the game through the course of it, since the goals (of each round) are mostly related to visible things like number of eggs/tokens, or birds in a certain row. These are just observations after one play though. The more I'm acquainted to Everdell, the more I'll recognize the (types/abilities of) cards. I already had fun playing it, finding combos, see it unwind –that's the most important :-)",199792

Only few actions with workers, so you need to think 4-5 action before, in order to create a perfect combo with cards, using just few resources. I gave 8 and not 10 because I think that there is a bit too much alea with cards. Sometimes there is a problem with cards shown on the ""garden"" area, because there isn't  a way to switch them indipendently from player's choices, so it happens that you have 3-4 similar card, and you can't change them (house rules power-grid style would be cool).

6462,tonycuv,10,"Most games, when you look at the box art, are either too heavily invested in the theme and the gameplay suffers (though that's more rare) or have a beautiful theme that isn't utilized nearly enough in gameplay and is really more just a ""skin"" than a real theme (i.e. Terra Mystica, Noria).  Everdell is one of the best examples of a healthy balance of theme-with-gameplay. Every aspect of this game feels delightful and light-hearted -- just as the box art seems to promise.  If playing a game where cute fantasy forest creatures building their cute fantasy forest civilization of awesomeness sounds fun to you, then you will really like this game because that is exactly what it delivers.   The mechanics (predominantly worker placement and resource management) are simple enough for relatively new tabletoppers to grasp quickly, but also somehow deep and satisfying enough for more seasoned gamers as well.   The potential strategies of this game are both deep and numerous, keeping Everdell returning to our table quite often, whenever we feel like a fun walk in the mystical woods.  Also, for all the ambience-ophiles out there - search ""fantasy forest ambience"" (or something like that) on youtube when you play :)",199792

That being said it's the sort of thing I generally enjoy and would rate it higher except:  1. It takes too long for what it is; the length will presumably go down a bit with experience, but probably not enough, in part because of  2. The deck is too large given how many cards and events require specific cards to be good (or in some cases do anything at all). In addition to making the game more random than it should be the vast number of different cards means that players are constantly re-evaluating to figure out their optimal moves.  3. There are a lot of card interactions which are difficult or impossible to figure out from the rules. It doesn't help at all if you have the various sets of extra cards, some of which don't seem very well-planned.  And while this is a lesser issue, it also doesn't help that if you actually use the board as intended everyone needs to sit more or less on the same side of the table as you can't see over the tree.",199792

6485,TradenMyr,9,"I was inspired by the lovely art and whimsical presentation of Everdell, but I backed it on the gameplay.  And it has not let me down! Everdell is a smooth experience with emergent gameplay. The game structure reminds me of Imperial Settlers or 51st State, with the combination of resources and engine building. The turns are fast (place a worker, play a card, or prepare for next season), with the only major upkeep being a twice per game production. The critters and constructions combo in both obvious and subtle ways, providing satisfaction in realizing the most efficient manner to build your city. Another interesting mechanism is the ability to play cards from both your hand and the meadow - 8 cards on the table shared amongst players. The shared pool of cards, as well as the shared event cards, makes for subtle competition as players rush to access things first. The variety is also nice - no two games will be the same between the thick deck and the random event and clearing cards.  The components are top notch as well. All of the bits feel great - the twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries. The giant tree is a bit over the top, but is functional in keeping the deck from falling over and is eye catching. The cards are of good quality, but I sleeved anyway to ease shuffling of the giant deck.  Very happy with this purchase, and hope it keeps on being amazing!  Kickstarted.",199792

6506,TristanGeeraert,9,"Review based on 56 plays (09/01/2024) Including: - Bellfaire - Pearlbrook - Spirecrest - Newleaf - Mistwood - Collector's Editions content  Everdell is a though one to rate for me. I played the base game around 15 times before starting to add expansion content one by one. I really adore this design: I love the artwork, the cosy theme, the beautiful components, and - most importantly - the satisfying gameplay. I also love the expansion content: the player powers introduced in Bellfaire are great to add asymmetry. The weather effects in Spirecrest can be though, but the expedition cards that you gain each time that you prepare for the next season act as an exciting counterweight. While I'm not the biggest fan of the wonders introduced in Pearlbrook, I really like the adornments and the unique water locations, as well as the extension of the main deck. Adding in these three expansions (as well as the additional content from Mistwood and the collector's editions) makes for a really long game, but it is still very satisfying to play.  Then came the Newleaf expansion which offered a complete new roster of cards and a new way to play critters cards for free (something that is more restricted in the base game). Since it is annoying to take out the Newleaf cards after a game, I prefer to keep them in the deck. However, if I play according to the Newleaf rulebook, I discoverd that I didn't like Everdell as much anymore. The tight gameplay that was so typical for Everdell was gone. It was often very easy to create a huge snowball effect early on in the game. This might sound exciting, but knowing base Everdell, this resulted in a less engaging game. The game arc was changed a lot by adding in Newleaf and I started playing Everdell less often. There is also another reason for the fact that I didn't wanted to remove the Newleaf cards: I really like their abilities a lot. In order to re-ignite my love for Everdell, I started experimenting with small house rules to regain the feeling of base Everdell with the addition of Newleaf (in addition to another couple of other small rule adjustments). These changes include:  - Permanently removing the Rugwort the Robber and Rugwort the Rowdy cards (as they add an incredibly punishing take-that effects that are not in line with the rest of the game). - Keeping the basic events in every game, also when you play with the wonders introduced in Pearlbrook (to not weaken the cards that have event related abilities). - Players gain a golden leaf token every time they prepare for season (instead of 3 at the start of the game) to diminish the snowball effect that Newleaf creates. - Corrin Evertail Cards may be activated only once per turn (to avoid mainly the OP effect of Corrin Evertail the Leader). - You only gain your train ticket once you have claimed your first event (either basic or special) to further diminish the Newleaf snowball effect.  So considering that I didn't want the remove the expansion content because I do love the additions they offer, but given that house rules were needed to keep the game fun for us, this one is not easy to rate. Remembering how much I loved base Everdell before ever trying any expansion content, I think this game still deserves a 9. I cannot give it a 10 any longer (which was my initial rating) due to the issues mentioned above, but Everdell is still a game that holds a special place in my collection, and one that I'm always eager to bring to the table again. It's not perfect. Some aspects of the game feel a little bit out of balance once adding expansion content (basic events or journey locations in autumn), some cards feel generally underpowered, and adding house rules is something I usually try to avoid at all cost. But nonetheless the positives still significantly outweigh the negatives for me. This beautiful game deserves the praise it gets and I'm glad I own it. It will see many plays in the years to come.

One major complaint, though: The first time I played it, we misunderstood the rules, and concluded that when a player prepared for the next season, they would wait to continue the game until all players had done so, resulting in all players beginning each season at the same time.

I really didn’t care what cards my opponents had, partly due to the small texts that I couldn’t read from a distance and didn’t bother about the bonus cards on the platform of the ridiculous tree.   Maybe it’s fun to play after a while (initially I wasn’t a fan Wingspan either, but now I really enjoy that) but I don’t think I’ll ever play it again, and won’t miss it.

6537,Turin14,8,"First impressions are good.  The game is fairly simple, but relies on paying attention to which cards interact with others - reading your own cards is easy, but seeing the cards displayed in the Meadow might allow you to miss some things.  It’s one of those games with a lot of small points that make up your score, so being able to capitalize on scoring cards, or seizing one of the public goals before everyone else could cause quite a swing - again, unfortunately, they are difficult to see and remember, since they are on top of the tree and have a lot of small text.   Replayability seems to be high - each game has different special worker placement spots, and the specific bonus event cards will change as well, giving a unique goal, and varied strategy to achieve them.  Personally, I might prefer these to be personal goals, but we’ll see how it goes - they definitely wouldn’t be balance if we dealt them out before the game.    We have yet to play the expansions, so maybe those will change how I feel about the game overall.  I definitely like the components and art.

6603,USSAwesome,9,"I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I do.  The gorgeous artwork immediately drew me in, but I resisted its pull because something about the symbology and text on the cards too closely resembled that of a collectible card game.  In actuality, Everdell is at its core a worker placement game with a curated menu of supporting mechanisms.  Players build a 15-card tableau to form their “towns,” which in turn act as engines to acquire resources and activate abilities.  Hands are limited to eight cards, all of which can be played onto the tableau or discarded in exchange for resources, victory points, different cards or discounts.  Open drafting is available in the form of an eight-card “meadow” that all players may access and use at any time, just as they would from their hand.  There is also a buffet of “events” that award victory points and provide goals to focus players’ efforts.   All these things mesh so seamlessly that the worker placement mechanism is the only one running in the foreground - each player will use just 15 total workers for the entire game, so none should be frivolously employed.  Meanwhile, all the supporting mechanisms are running subconsciously.  There are tons of little satisfying moments, like playing a creature card for free because you already own its preferred construction, or putting a “fool” with negative point value into your dungeon, thereby erasing him and receiving a discount on something you want to build, perhaps simultaneously earning points by satisfying a special event requirement - a real lemonade from lemons moment.  This is a game that benefits from multiple plays, as becoming well acquainted with the abilities of each card is crucial to getting the full experience.  The components are outstanding, though the showy “Ever Tree” that towers over the board is nothing more than a fancy display shelf which actually makes it harder for all players to get a good view of its contents.  There is occasionally the problem of the cards you desperately need never surfacing, but usually one can identify new angles and opportunities, pivoting into them and often making new discoveries as a result.  And “discovery” is the word I would use to sum up what I love so much about the game.  There always seems to be something to discover in a game of Everdell, and I always end up trying new tactics with or without intention.  It’s great at every player count - and yes, I have played several rounds of the solo game.  I am so happy that it lived up to the hype.",199792

6628,velo333,7,"Quite interesting game with a few unnecessary elements. It's not a trivial family game as seems to be at the first sight - not so hard but it requires some planning and strategy skills. After few games i used to develop nice combos hands down. Usually i used to play less than an hour (2 players), but in my opinion downtime may appear.  I like playing creatures for free (with proper structures) and mechanics of card rebuilding. Seasons are nice too - you can wait one turn more to block a field desired by your opponent. A shared market (meadow) is a nice idea for reduce randomness.  Cardboard tree is very low quality (polish edition) and unwieldy. It's only for decorative purposes. I prefer easy-accesible flat board. On the face of it, this game offers awesome action chaining - but it's only a illusion. Combos are shallow - it's more tactical than strategical game.  Summary, in my opinion it isn't up to scratch. Don't get me wrong, it's nice game (i voted for 7, Q1 2020) but i expected something different.",199792

6630,Venaen,9,It is really one of our favourites. A game that happens to be on the table very often even though I'm not big fan of euro games.

You have to balance when to play your workers, when to play the cards, when to obstruct other players, have a plan if someone else blocks you, when to grab the objectives. Literally everything has to (or can) be considered each turn, and that makes the game very satisfying. The game objectives sometimes feel impossible to do, or aren't worth the hassle. Playing it for a bunch of times makes you appreciate all of the cards in the game. Which is a great thing, the game has depth and staying power as to play it for a good while",199792

What really makes this game stand out however, besides the amazing look/feel of the game, is the card chaining. Certain constructions allow you to bring in critters for free which may allow for bigger combos later... but at the cost of one of your precious fifteen slots in your card tableau.

Reminds of 51st state, but better since you're not stuck with your cards. There are common cards you can play, discard your cards for points, etc.  1P: Not quite like the base game. Medium+ difficulty has a heavy emphasis on special events. These require 2 specific cards each to be in your city, and you might not see one of them in the game (or they might be blocked if you do). This is the biggest problem -- need luck to get more than 1 special event. Also, every time you play a card, the AI gets at least 2 points, so you have to be very careful about growing your city. This is somewhat counter to the multi-player strategy -- cards that help you get other cards out (Crane, Innkeeper) may be a liability, and preference given to high point cards like King, Architect, etc. The fact that you're sometimes better off for not playing cards (that you would in a multi-player game) just AIN'T RIGHT.

There is no way anyone would play this game 100% correctly with all the ongoing effects / bonuses to remember with multiple expansions in play.

6740,wayner76,10,Overall I think that this game is one of the best I've ever played.   I've had the game for about 2 weeks and I'd say we have played the game over 30 times.   There is quite a bit of replay value because your card hands are always different.   You will also get to figure out strategies throughout the game and find your own way to win.   Great game with 2 players and just as fun with 4.   The reason I didn't give it a 10 is because there are forest cards on the side plus special event cards and they didn't make that many. (11 forest cards). I hope they can correct this with future expansions and more to that element of the game.   Very easy to learn and not too complex.,199792

As someone with ADHD and not always great planning strategies, having such short rounds initially and only a few seasons isn't that desirable to me.  Also, the way we like to play games is for everybody to be engaged.  But in Everdell's rules, it's possible for one player to end up taking multiple turns while everybody else has nothing to do.  That happened to us in a group of four once.  Since we primarily play games for the fun and socialization aspect, we're not as fond of some of the rules of this game as of others.  But they can be modified fairly easily to make the game a lot more enjoyable for us personally.",199792

6751,Wendyjo73,10,"Wow!  I am so so happy my husband backed this wonderful game on Kickstarter!  I am enthralled!   First of all, as an artist, I am so in love with the artwork. It’s simply stunning!  Kudos to the artist! Secondly, this is a fantastic worker placement game. So many great options for workers, it’s hard to choose.  I love the tableau building aspect. At first, I thought it might be difficult to reach the 15 card limit in my city by the end of the game. Nope. It is really timed very well. Of course, luck comes into play with what cards you get, but we played back to back tonight and never had a problem maximizing our options in our cities.  It did seem to run quite a bit longer than the box suggested, and the first game we expected that. But it wasn’t much faster the second time. With 2 players, it took us about an hour and a half. Of course, once we get a better feel for what the cards do, I’m sure that will speed up.  The only other negatives would be the twigs that roll easily and the tree being a bit thinner than it probably should have been.  Oh, and I’m concerned about trying to fit 4 players in with the way the tree blocks one whole side.  But, all of the negatives combined couldn’t even convince me to shave one point off my review because I enjoyed this game so much, I immediately wanted to play again right after. I LOVE this game!  Highly recommend!!",199792
6752,Wentu,6,"I was expecting much much more from all the reviews and ratings around. It really did not manage to catch my attention. Take resource, pay for card, apply little power, repeat over and over and over again. Art and components are really really nice but they are not enough to give me an interesting gaming experience.

6761,whatsabandicoot,4,"First impressions are positive; the bright artwork and tactile components are very nice. Gameplay is a disappointment, though. Think Lorenzo resource tightness meets a Terraforming Mars sized deck, however without any staging or guarantee of how much you'll see of it. At 2P I wonder how swingy it may be with limited card pool options available. While not strictly comparable, there don't appear to be the mitigations present in other deck-driven games for poor card draws nor the flexibility of resources to pivot strategy. If you're behind the curve to begin with, it seems likely you'll be behind for the rest of the game bar a fortuitous draw.  10 plays: unfortunately, first impressions have held true. The meadow tends to stagnate in 2P, with limited methods for drawing cards to counteract this (exasperated by the hard 8 card hand limit). As such, starting hands become very influential in how much success you're likely to have in the game against competent players (a 2P fan variant, ""the border"", helps but doesn't resolve this). Would be interesting to see how it feels when played repeatedly at higher player counts.",199792

The worker actions are not exciting at all - get some resources, get a new card - and the cards are really forgettable and minor in their effect (there are also not that many unique cards). There are some combos that you think might get an engine running, but you don't feel like there is anything substantial coming out of that - just more resources to get or a couple more points. Moreover, whatever you do seems meaningless in the end as every action/card gives very little and you get to play lots of them. A pretty (I don't even like the art, to be honest, it seems so generic), but hollow experience. Also, the theme is non-existent, never did I feel like doing more than just moving resources around to get cards and points.  The solo mode is decent, too bad it's attached to such a bland game.",199792

6857,xerossilence,8.4,"Lovely game. It's a fairly straightforward worker placement game with a healthy amount of tableau building on top.   The worker placement part of the game is pretty simple. Place a worker, get some stuff. Some locations only fit one person. Others fit multiple. I do like that there are some locations added to each game form a pool of cards. This is a great way to mix it up and keep the game fresh. Same goes for the event cards.   The cards and the tableau I think are the high point of the game. The art on the cards is lovely. I love the interaction between creatures and constructions, where some constructions allow for certain creatures for free. The card abilities were interesting and varied, and I really liked the interactions they had amongst each other. In our first game, my friend ended up with only about 10 cards somehow, and I spent the last season and a half trying to cannibalize one card to get another in play.   The board is lovely. I wish more games did not have a square/rectangular board. Again, I loved that some locations were placed on the board in the form of cards, so locations will change from game to game.   The tree is pretty, and I like the feel it gives to the board. That said, I am really struggling with how much damage this thing is taking every time I try to assemble it. Edges of some of the pieces get pulled back when they are slotted through another part of the tree, meaning I know this will end up looking a bit ratty in no time. I know there are upgrades out there for a permanently set up (wooden?) tree, but that takes space I just don't have. I really would have loved for the tree to be some kind of popup board type mechanism, hinged like a game board so that it can be flattened without disassembly.    The seasons were both a point of interest in the game, and maybe a drawback for me. As there is no 'pickup workers' option unless someone is moving to the next season, if you are in the next season while your opponent is still in the previous season, they can really clog up the works for you, taking all the valuable/needed spots. That made for an interesting dynamic in our game. At the same time, that we were only going through one year, and we only start off with two workers, I felt like I did very little for the first few seasons. I almost wish the game spanned two years to allow for more turns. Given this limitation, I did feel a bit more AP knowing how little wiggle room I had for actions.   Overall, really enjoyed the game.

6870,xjanx,7.8,"A nice game with beautifuly designed cards. I did not really like the tree since you need to be very careful with it to not destroy the edges. The overall game concept is great but it feels a bit too short overall. This in itself can be a nice thing because many medium to complex games often take too long. However it removes a bit of theotherwise would have been more fun aspect of the engine building. A bit strange is that the first one or two round are quite short while only the last round (of 4) can take longer than the previous 3. A minus is that there is not much interaction with other players except that one player might steal a card or an available action so that the other can't use it for their own decks. Also it is quite a bit of luck to get the right cards for the strategies you have in mind. And if you don't get many of such good cards it can easily decide who wins. At the same time this is a plus for playing with people who are not the most competitive. Therefore when choosing a a little more complex game for a family game night or for playing with new players it is still among the better options. Replayability is ok but not great. On one hand the many different cards allows for variations but in genereal the detailed game mechanics and effects of actions are understood just a bit too fast. Overall for medium complexity players still a great choice in my opinion. Works well with 2 players. For more players, especially in the last round, it could become tiring because everyone needs to think a lot about the best actions to get thze most points.",199792

6873,Xmael,9,"Un city building precioso en mesa, sencillo de reglas y con la suficiente profundidad para que las partidas sean entretenidas y muy reñidas. Se vende como un juego de combos pero no hay la suficiente sinergia directa entre cartas para que esos combos involucren a varias a la vez. Aun así, las activaciones que provocan algunas cartas te incitan a buscar el mejor momento para jugarlas o la mejor combinación con una segunda carta que aumente los efectos, por lo que no es un juego de bajo cualquier cosa que tenga porque va a combinar bien con algo que llegue más adelante. Sobre todo esto no es así porque la cantidad de recursos que hacen falta y las pocas vías de conseguirlos hace que te lo pienses mucho si te merece la pena arriesgarte a bajar una carta u otra. Probablemente esta falta de recursos sea el mayor lastre para el jugador novato, ya que en las dos primeras estaciones parece que el juego no fluye bien y cualquier mala decisión lastra la experiencia de los primeros turnos. Pero una vez superado ese escalón, y empiezas a aprovechar los efectos de las cartas jugadas todo lo demás es una delicia",199792

6876,Xonim,6,"Solid worker placement game with some neat hand management allowing you to build some cards for free if you have certain other cards in your hand. Playing cards is just as much, if not a bigger part of the game as the placing a worker bit, so that's cool. Components are all top notch in the collector's edition. The 3D tree is a great looking gimmick, but it doesn't actually serve any gameplay purpose. The legendary mini expansion included with the collector's edition is great. They're just better cards of some already good cards -- so much so, you can almost build a strategy around them. Overall, I felt the board was a bit too open at 2p, and really enjoyed how tight it was at 3p. The later part of the game would be even slightly tighter at 4p, so I think 3-4p is the sweet spot.",199792

6883,Xstream,9,"Really thought this one would be a bit too dry for me (mechanically), since It's WP, which I normally don't like, but having tried It now, I was wrong! Lovely balance in complexity and streamlined play. Good combo options with a perfect balance in complexity. A relaxing experience, but still with some brain burning at times.   It's in the line of Wingspan. Top notch production, art, streamlined card combo play, but for me, Everdell Is the better game. Now you can also clearly compare and see why that is. Luck of the draw has less impact, because It has a more balanced deck and mostly because of the open market (Meadow) and achievements that are for everybody the same. More like milestones.  I hate in Wingspan you can get (private) bonus achievements that are often impossible to achieve. It's so much more ""we'll see what I can do with the cards I get"", where Everdell gives much more control to play a strategy.  Having played now a few times it’s clear that there are many valid strategies to win with.  One bigger negative though.   In some games the cards come out weird and bogged down the gameplay a bit. Since we all had the same problem because so much is public it doesn’t really matter, but it just doesn't play so well,  I.e.: Like, no production cards in the beginning, coming at the end instead when you don't need them. Getting a bunch of critters without being able to combo off their houses. Things like that. Maybe It wouldn't be a bad idea to introduce something like Machi Koro did with their newer releases to categorise what cards come out and when so there's a healthy balance in every game.   Also you need reading glasses if your eyes aren't 100% anymore. It has generally small card text, but there's also mini text with essential! info. Which is odd considering how much eye for detail went into the game production.   But otherwise the production and art is top notch!  Aside from these nags this is one of my favourite games.

6899,YamiLyon,6.5,"Wow, does this game have table presence! Absolutely gorgeous! The tree is totally unnecessary, but such a nice touch =)  Everdell is a streamlined, elegant and simple enough worker placement/tableau building/engine building game that provides the fun and satisfying experience of building a little woodland society. It provides an engaging 60-90 minutes if you wanna play something less convoluted than the likes of Agricola, Terraforming Mars and Race for the Galaxy.   However, while amusing, the gameplay is not particularly original, especially for a 2018 game. Placing workers, getting resources, exchanging those resources to play cards... we've all seen it before. And while fun, because of that I don't think Everdell will be able to keep my interest for the long term, despite the replayability because of the deck, the available events and the available forest actions.   Also, not getting the right combinations of critter-construction can put a little downer on the game if you're unlucky (the biggest strike against tableau-building in general), although this is somewhat mitigated by the myriad of possibilities to draw cards.   Overall, a very fine game with stunning aesthetics that just doesn't offer anything new gameplay-wise in a massive market. ",199792

Nothing wrong with that, but I'd rather play any of those aforementioned games before playing this again. Res Arcana and RFTG are cheaper and set up and play in about a quarter of the time as Everdell without constantly churning through an oversized deck.   Yes, there is a worker placement element absent from those other games, but there are so many other ways/options to get what most spaces provide that it's impossible to block in any meaningful way. It's only worker placement in how it limits how many moves you can make.   Again, I liked it, just not sure how much this will ultimately get played. Too many similar games that I prefer.",199792

The game is all about finding card combinations that will catapult your city to the front while conserving your resources and your precious meeples.   The shared ""meadow"" card market is fantastic, it helps mitigate bad luck card draws and adds nice tension between players because anyone could grab that card you want. As the rounds progress, you get more workers and more options to build to out your city.  Probably the best thing I can say is that it is liked by both my euro-heavy-number-crunchy friends and my more light-strategy-theme-loving friends.

6980,Zephouria,9,"A couple playthroughs in, the seasons make more sense. It needs a lot of space to play, more than a card table, but it's a gorgeous game that is somehow both intense and relaxing. The art on the cards is beautiful and I'll be honest, I play less for points and more to get as many critters matched into homes as possible ",199792

6982,zerbia88,6,"With expansions this game can be good. But even then, its rare. What I find is the main problem with Everdell is the downtime does not justify the complexity. I have played multiple games that were 3+ hours, and multiple tuns that felt like 10 minutes before it came back around to me. Which in this game is insane because your turn consists of either placing a worker or playing a card. I would only play this with people who are guaranteed to play this fast or with 3 or less players. ",199792

A játékmenettel kapcsolatban pedig elfogult vagyok, mert ez a fajta munkáslehelyezős tablóépítés nagy kedvenc nálam, mégha semmi eredetiség nincs is az Everdellben. A meglévő és ismert mechanikákat remekül egybegyúrták, szuper élmény a vele való játék!",199792
6990,Zgething,9.8,So so fun this game is amazing!! Almost a cozier version of 7 wonders Duel with more depth. Very surprised this game only has an 8/10- so much replayability and the expansions seem to add a lot of variety.,199792

6992,zhstalt,8.2,"Solid worker-placement, tableau-builder.  It's gorgeous to look at and engaging.  I love the lack of organized rounds and first player jockeying that seems forced in older worker-placement games.   I've got 5 plays under my belt between 2 and 4 players.  All were good.  2 needs a little help to cycle through more of the cards, but 3 and 4 are tight.  And, for once, building a big engine isn't an auto-win.  I like that the game is tight early from lack of workers/options, like Agricola, but gets tighter towards the end as the action spots don't increase with worker count.  Good balance there.  Overall, very happy with the game.",199792
