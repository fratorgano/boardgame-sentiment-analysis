Lovely artwork everywhere . Smooth game play mechanisms - ironed out some oddities of the original game . Fortunes change frequently , so the winner could be anyone . Minus points : The board and card artwork is generally too dark ( even on the light side of the board ) , making it hard for some people to see detail clearly , especially under artificial lights in the evening . The rules are all in the rule book . Not necessarily where you ' d expect to find them though . The addition of beer , manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword : Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players . We found the need for beer to get most things done annoying . Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough . Lots of fiddly network / connection rules that everyone forgot at some point , necessitating a lot of reversing what you ' ve just done in order to replace it with something legal . AP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities .

Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make , from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up , new trade networks being established , or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down . Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing . Everything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers . The hand management , turn order manipulation based on your spending , the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era , these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts . The rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems , and the Roxley production is very pretty , but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal / rail links .

They are deep , thinky and very interactive . On the other hand , they are very AP inducing ( perhaps more than any other game I ' ve played ) , the rules are ' quirky ' and the card play feels odd to me . This feels more like a variant than a standalone game . I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version .\n",

Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning ( especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else ) , but this leads to an immense depth of play . The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage . At higher player counts , the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent . It also actually feels like a simulation , instead of an exercise in number crunching . The beer element might feel a bit tacked on , but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final \" oomf \" to the strategy . One of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I ' ve played , though it might not look very clean the first time you play . Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action !\n",

            "[2024-07-04 14:30:59] (2.4.1.post1) Example 0: This is more or less the same game as the original Brass except for the increased number and the new type of industries and the additional resource ( beer ) . The basic mechanics are the same still . However since there are more types of industry , players have more options for specialising . In other words , this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original . The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain . Another change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects . Instead the industries have a specific link value ( 0 - 2 VP ) thus complicating the things a bit . I really cannot decide between this and the original . This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original ( although badly written which just happens to be Wallace ’ s trademark ) .\n",

I stayed away from this game for a long time because the theme doesn ' t appeal to me and because I ' m in general not a fan of most Euros . While the theme feels very much painted on , this game is a hybrid and not a pure Euro - style game . The game is as much about player conflict ( via area control ) as much as it is about building an economic engine . The game also encourages table - talk and presents opportunities for deal - making . But the thing that stands out the most is how intricate and yet tight / crisp the puzzle is . Like Ark Nova ( my favorite Euro ) , this game requires you to play your hand instead of waiting for cards to fit your strategy , and I love that . There is also so much scope for deep strategy in this game . The game is not without its flaws though . First , the game is not thematic at all - and that ' s always a big negative for me personally . Second , the game does not have a catch - up mechanism . Once someone is ahead , it ' s very likely they ' ll win . Also , a couple of bad early moves pretty much kill your game . I also found the whole beer / different industries mechanic to be kind of unnecessary . I ' ve watched online plays of Brass : Lancashire which doesn ' t have this mechanic , and I think that might be a better fit , at least for people starting out with the Brass system . Brass : Birmingham almost feels like an expansion to Brass : Lancashire that should not be played as your first game . All in all , I ' d like to play this game more and can see my rating going up .

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great . It is one of those games that you can ' t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off . Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use . There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build , into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings . The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs , money costs , end game points , and income . There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you . The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto . The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both . The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going , laying down rails , getting some buildings out , then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era . It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing . The artwork and components are top notch , nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in . A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions . Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been . I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine . I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack , you often can ' t reach that side of the board , and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what . I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile , or a cube on a numbered track , or something else . The day / night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game . . . but it probably doesn ' t need it . There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies . The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about . Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time . I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around . For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going . It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy , but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game . Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff .\n",

I have only played it at two players and it was a good time but I think it plays a bit better at 3 + players . I do have a couple cons to share though . I found myself falling into analysis paralysis A LOT during turns . There ' s so much to do in this game and often times it ' s not very clear what ' s the way to victory . Also , this is not a game for everyone . This is a hard game both to learn and to teach since there are so many nuances to the networks and resources . This is not a game I can always get to the table . Also , set up took a pretty long time , all those pieces on the player boards take a while to set up , though I think that could be eased with inserts , though that ' s an extra purchase . Still , it ' s an incredibly satisfying game when things go your way . Selling multiple businesses in a single turn and getting that huge payout of income feels great . But I can see how this can be very intimidating in some groups . Proceed with caution but if it feels like it ' s up your alley , grab it !\n",

            "[2024-07-04 14:31:30] (2.4.1.post1) Example 0: Brass : Birmingham is a sequel to Brass : Lancashire by Martin Wallace ( Railways of the World , AuZtralia , Wildlands ) . It is a card - driven hand management game in the Industrial Age . Players build the infrastructure ( industries and routes ) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points . [ b ] What makes it special ? [ / b ] * Tight intertwined system : hand management , creating and connecting industries , money and income management * Synergy between players : players benefit from resources and networks of other players ( players build a mutual board and use what each other has made ) * 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game [ b ] Pros : [ / b ] + Artwork Beautiful map , industry tiles , and cards , good iconography , table presence + Theme Industrial Age , historic , capitalism , economic , England . The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories . + Components Double sided boards : day or night , standard wooden cubes for coal and iron , custom wooden beer barrels , high quality tokens , cards , and player boards + Many paths to victory Ship cotton , manufacturing goods , pottery ( focus on one vs mix of all ) . Provide coal , iron , and / or beer . Build links for additional points . Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets . + Two eras ( similar , but different ) The game is split into two eras each triggers scoring . After the first canal era , all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings . Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era , let you score them twice ( efficiency play ) . Moreover , all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links . Each era ends if all cards have been played . + The develop action ( immediate benefit vs efficiency ) The develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron . It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice . + Network building ( optimal routes and scoring ) Links are build to connect locations used to consume coal / beer , buy / sell coal , ship goods , or score victory points . First canals then replaced by more expensive rails . All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players ( synergy ) . Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles . It creates deep decision - making : how to connect locations / industries to consume coal / beer and to ship to the next available market ? Moreover , each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era ( very restrictive ) . Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles ( clever incentive to still build links ) + Driven by hand management with multi - used cards ( complex decision - making , options vs restrictions , timing ) Each player has a hand limit of 8 cards . Players play 2 cards per turn ( except for the first round ) . Cards show either a location or industry . Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map . Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected ( ! ) location . At the end of a round , players draw 2 cards . The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time ( can be mitigated by wild cards ) . + Wild cards ( flexibility ) A player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere ( flexibility ) + Discard any card for various actions ( flexibility ) A player can discard any card for various other actions : develop canals or railroads , take a loan , ship goods , develop to upgrade ( remove ) industry tiles from player board , or pass . + Timing ( immediate benefit vs efficiency ) One discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations . Efficiency balancing act : wait or ship to gain at least some benefit / income from now to the rest of the game ? Will there be enough resource left next turn ? [ - ] + Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get [ / - ] + Loans for instant cash income ( flexibility ) Loans reduce one ' s income level to get instant 30 $ . Loans are never paid back , instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative . + Resource management ( coal , iron , and bear ) Iron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board . Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market ( distant port ) location ( unintuitive , network building , synergy ) + Dynamic common market for resources ( flexibility , money or cost generator ) Players can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board . Creates flexibility : but costs money when buying or gain money when selling ) . Buying or selling coal ( not iron ) requires a link to any market ( unintuitive ) + Shipping goods to flip industry tiles ( scoring ) Shipped or cleared tiles ( by any player ) will flip an industry tile ( of any player ) . Flipped industry tiles increase the income , add links used to score connected locations , and provide victory points at the end of an era ( synergy ) + Need for beer to ship goods ( additional layer ) Beer is additionally needed to either ship crates , cottons mills , and pottery ( adds an additional requirement / layer to think about ) or to build two rail links at once ( costs vs efficiency ) + Balance of upgrading buildings : lower level building provide money , higher level buildings provide victory points + Turn order by spent money It is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round . E . g . , each player has two actions . If a player uses the second action to build a new link , the next player may be the first to benefit from it . Moreover , a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row ( strategic , careful planning ) + Random set - up ( variability , replayability ) Demand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently + Helpful player boards Show all the information for upgrading buildings , cubes and money ( clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass : Lancashire ) + Clarity Clear player boards , player aids , and iconography ( most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography ) . Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state . + Motivating game arc ( escalation ) Restrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era . Building links in the beginning of an era . Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era . + Scales well with all player counts ( but still better with 3 - 4 players ) + Complex interaction but still accessible ( artwork and streamlined mechanisms ) + Brief , well written rules ( 12 pages ) However , no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners . The rules are missing some important information ( see below ) + Game box has a nice plastic insert [ b ] Neutrals : [ / b ] # The crate / manufacturing good is very generic / abstract # Language independent ( only names of cities on the cards and board ) # High player interaction due to different synergy effects # Sandbox game ( no specific objectives for the players ) # Some hidden information ( cards in hands of the other players ) # Luck of the draw for cards # Locations are color - coded on the map and cards Helps to find a location , however , it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham # Heavy , complex , thinking game ( high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone ! ) # Deluxe edition Has poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens , thicker cardboard , there is no exclusive game content ( + ) . The delivered box was extremely well packed ( + ) # Quick comparison to Brass : Lancashire No distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations , no ships replaced by pottery , random goods on random location for shipping , beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell , players can sell to as many different locations as they want ( flexibility ) , new links to score victory points ( symbols on tiles and locations ) , scout action replace wild cards , simplified loans ( only 30 $ ) , bigger coal / iron market , little more complex player board [ b ] Cons : [ / b ] - Potentially overwhelming The rules are not complicated but the high , interconnected complexity and sandbox - style of the game may be overwhelming for some / most people : the side - effects of actions are not that intuitive , especially for beginners . How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required ? - Bothersome exchange of money tokens ( discipline ) Do not directly pay money to the bank ( important to keep track of player order , but still annoying ) . However , you will get use to it . ( - ) Setting up the player boards Placing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time , however , there is not much else to set - up . - Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income [ i ] A player ' s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other . As they share the same track , when in proximity to each other , their different shapes aren ' t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two . [ / i ] ( thanks to Barry Miller ) [ b ] Thoughts : [ / b ] Brass : Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value , high synergistic player interaction , and crunchy decision - making . The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions . Depending on your cards , you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes . Managing money , resources , industries , links , and timing is a very difficult balancing act . Brass : Birmingham offers an intertwined , complex system that comes with very few rules . It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018 ! [ b ] Similar games : [ / b ] * Brass : Lancashire / Age of Industry Very similar gameplay , a little less layers and variability . More unforgiving , because every decision counts . Different available maps for Age of Industry . Both games by Martin Wallace . * On Mars Synergistic player interaction , a lot of options , less streamlined , steep learning curve . * Autobahn Synergistic network building plus pick up and delivery with Concordia - style hand management . * Railways of the World Less complex , focus on route building , some synergy via route sharing , simpler supply and demand for delivering goods , loans and income , event cards ( more randomness ) , auctions for player order , by Martin Wallace . * Wildcatters Synergistic network building with cut - throat denying of oil barrels or shares . * Imperial Steam [ b ] Missing rules : [ / b ] * What happens if you run out of iron cubes ? https : / / boardgamegeek . com / thread / 2028859 / lack - orange - iron - cubes * How to draw cards at the start of the rail era ? https : / / boardgamegeek . com / thread / 2031687 / draw - 8 - cards - start - rail - era\n",

I ' ll still play it if someone is really keen on it , but I would rather play Via Nebula ( Brass Lite in 45 - 60 min ) or a different game for 2 - 3 hours . Very interesting Euro , with both tactics and strategy required . Players need to use their opponents ' resources and connections , but using them too much negates the benefit . You should have an idea of what you want to do ( can ' t do everything , so formulate an idea ahead of time ) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle . Most of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive , although setup was long . The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day , as the options are either wide open ( first round ) or extremely isolated ( second half ) . I enjoyed the \" Very tactical with strategy \" style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played . I ended up selling this , not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me , but because the people who would play it with me all own it .

Here , because the cards are spread over more industries , it ' s possible to get shutout of some strategies depending on your draw - you really do have to listen to your cards and go along , developing something coherent based on what you get and hope the cards you get in the second era play along with what you have on the board . As such , I think I like this version more than the original because it feels harder to develop coherency . I certainly preferred having more control over the sales / deliveries through the construction / use of beer barrels ( a thematic sigh . . . just go with it ) .

Strong core mechanics , very compelling and elegant gameplay and the most kick - ass production for a Euro I have ever seen ( without being over - produced like most KS games I see ) . This is Brass done right . Can ' t wait to play again . . . & again ! My biggest critique of the game ( if at all ) is related to its major strength — aesthetics . While the art IS spectacular and looks just that on the computer screen where the light of a thousand suns from tiny pixels bring out all the details , I am afraid the printing process does not do justice to the darker palette . This severely impairs the playing of the game in sub - optimal lighting conditions ( many cafes , pubs and non - game room areas in condo apartments have this problem ) . The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify ( again , ONLY in sub - optimal lighting conditions ) Having said that , it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and / well - lit rooms . I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been . Also , because of the Kickstarter success , it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5 - 6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles . Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc . Love the Iron Clays though . . . cant imagine playing without them !\n",

The original Brass game was a brilliant design , that nevertheless , not surprisingly , had certain well known , dominant strategies which allowed you to win the game more often than not . Thus , after several plays , you clearly knew what you had to do to win the game . Brass Birmingham , to its credit , clearly set out to blow up those dominant strategies , and in their place , substitute subtle , new complex strategic and tactical decisions . If you follow the old Brass strategies with this game , it seems to me , you will lose . Here , we have before us a whole new Brass type challenge : cards , flipping chits , connections , money concerns , and two phases . My only knock on this game is the art .
